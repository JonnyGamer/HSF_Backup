Suggestions for improving Hopscotch,Meta - Hopscotch,-,No,"Hey guy! I'm JonnyGamer new to the Forum, but not in hopscotch. Um, let's see, I really think you guys should add a text button, so you can communicate with your friends faster and share projects with each other. You could also ask for help with it to popular hopscotchers. The text button would be really great. Uh, also, the follow should be more like 'friend' to communicate better and see what they are doing like a mini blog, or a new level they are creating. I will post more ideas later...",5,0,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/suggestions-for-improving-hopscotch/138/145,2015-10-15 03:03:29 UTC
Ideas for a *NEW HOPSCOTCH UPDATE*,Meta - Hopscotch,-,No,"I think a 'Text me!' would be great to add to hopscotch profiles.

Texting In Hopscotch?!?,Meta - Hopscotch,-,No,"Hey guys! This is a great idea I've been thinking about. I thought that if we could make a 'Text Me!' button so you can communicate faster. Also, you could share projects with your friends maybe even before you've published them, so you could make mega collabs. I think this would be a great way to have people help each others, and ask for help from popular hopscotchers. Thanks!

Has Hopscotch gone too far?,Deprecated (Help with Code),-,No,"I really don't like this arguement. It wasn't much of a big deal at first, and now look what's happening! I think this was a big misunderstanding and there wasn't any communication. The rules of hopscotch say that you are not allowed beg for likes, instead, just have fun and create cool projects. @Funky63, be careful what you say, not meaning what you said was wrong, but many people look up to you and see what you post. I personally think, that we should just get back to programming and not pay attention to people begging for likes. Hopscotch is supposed to be a friendly community and not how popular you are base on the like count. Hopscotch is a fun tool to program on and share projects,  and us as leaders should be good examples for the others so we can keep it that way.

There is no right answer to this question, even though you all think it is false. The reason false is correct, is because of Euclidian geometry. This geometry states that parallel lines can never meet or triangles can have a max of one right angle. The reason it is true is because of non-Euclidian geometry, otherwise know as hyperbolic geometry. This geometry is on a globular surface, not the surface of a plane. This make a few 3D shapes two dimensional. If you look at the longitude lines on a globe (up and down) they are parallel, yet they meet at the poles. Also, longitude and latitude lines can make triangles with three right angles (search it up on the Internet). This may not seem to make sense, but that's ok. Hyperbolic geometry is used in 3D computer design and three dimensional video games or animated movies.",3,0,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/is-there-such-thing-as-parallel-lines-that-intersect-a-triangle-with-two-or-even-three-right-angles/4579/6,2016-01-06 01:29:09 UTC
Is there such thing as parallel lines that intersect? A triangle with two or even three right angles?,Math,-,No,"The definition of parallel means that lines cannot intersect on a flat surface. In non-Euclidian math, the surface of the globe is 2D which means that parallel lines on a globe may intersect.

Anyway, this will be the biggest drawing pad Collab. Ever. It will have 216 colors and be a huge project. I will take only five members, so look fast! I also need 5 HSB finders which they will need to find:
16 reds, 16 oranges, 16 yellows, 32 greens, 32 blues, 16 purples/pinks, 16 Browns, 128 tones (skin/hair colors and mainly darker colors), and finally, 24 shades. I will also need 3 beta testers to test things. Anyway, how do you become a member of this Collab?
1. You must have been in a finished art pad Collab
2. You must be very dedicated with your work
3. You must finish assignments on time

If you have any more questions, ask me here. Thanks!

PETITION! Remove this word from the filter!,Deprecated (Help with Code),-,No,"When we all signed up for the Hopscotch Forums, we all signed the terms of agreements. The terms of agreement states that we have all agreed to follow the rules, for example we can't type certain things that may be offensive to someone. I think that we should all respect that and which words we are not allowed to use. I also think that talking about LGBT and being gay is not Hopscotch related at all, and really shouldn't be mentioned. Even the Hopscotch team said that religions are not allowed supposed to be talked about because it can spark arguments like this. Lastly, the forums are supposed to be about sharing ideas about Hopscotch, not about religions or other unrelated ideas. I say if you want to talk about other things, please do it elsewhere.

Help Hopscotch fix draft deletion bugs,Deprecated (Help with Code),-,No,"Many deletion bugs happen in collab accounts. Here's one that misfortunately happened to me.

There are saving bugs if two people are working on a draft the same time. One time I was editing a drawing pad and quit the app, but had it still on the drawing pad while I was on another app. I com back and it reloads. I search for the drawing pad and it is GONE!!

Another bug/issue is if you publish a draft with no title, it disappears from the community and there is no way to retrieve it.

One more thing: why is the beta app 15 weeks before the original? It makes everything confusing like publishing projects don't show up, drafts I had deleted a while ago show up.

I also have some ideas for future updates, if you'd like me to show tell you them, I can

You kids don't even have opinions!"" Everyone's eyes widened and we looked at our teacher who was nodding her head in a way like she wasn't even paying attention with the slow motion blinking.

###The Game Coders:
These people code games; not much anything else

###The Art Coders:
These people make designs and stuff; not many games

###The all around coders:
Code basically everything

###The drawers
Draw things; very little coding

###The chat room peeps
These people want to communicate (ahem ahem messages update)

###The Collabers
These people basically are a mixture of everything, but collating is the majority

###The like beggers 
They whine for likes

###Popular people
Take advantage of their popularness and create amazing things
Unless they're famous for drawing. That's different.

###Bragging popular people
Basically they are popular people who are like, ""Look at me!!""

###The sort of popular coders
People know about them (they get 10-25 likes per project)

###The unpopular
Nobody knows.... 

###The no one knows about at all people
Not necessarily newbs, but they get 0 likes

###The newbs
Either just joined and have no clue or they really don't understand coding

###The mix of everything
They draw and code

###The Haters
They hate on people, but you might have known that

###The multiple accounters
They have many accounts not just one

###The true remixers
Remix projects and make them even better or congratulate creators

###The bad remixers
Remix projects saying they actually made them

###the copycats
Copycat coding ideas and get tons of credit

###the quitters
They quit",3,1,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/the-different-types-of-hopscotchers/14822/15,2016-05-07 13:50:24 UTC

.      My name is JonnyGamer. I love coding on Hopscotch and I have been on since August 2014. I usually code games, but the new HSB and RGB block have made me coding more art and rainbow-y projects. I have two accounts, JonnyGamer and Quantum9. I have been featured twice and the projects are Flappymoji! and Gravity Cube v1.2. 
.      I would like to apply for this collab as a coder. I have many years of experience and know how to shade, use sin/cos, do math projects, and all sorts of things! (2D Sandbox by Quantum9 check it out: https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/xyuwagn10) (Sin/Cos project by Quantum9: https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/xyhbwj6js, https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/xzt3r6sko) I have had many attempts making art pads. My best one had normal colors (because I had no idea what the color value cheat was) with a split and quadrant draw. (Took me a very long time with many check if/else because I did it without color values) I have this design for a drawing pad called the 2016pad (I have another one called Obsidian pad). I haven't gotten around to making them, and I can show both of them if you want to. Thanks!

(Put periods there because indents wouldn't work because of bad programming, sorry)

Why would you want to leave only because you don't get featured? I love hopscotch because you get to be creative and beneducated in the world of coding. If you love coding, it shouldn't be because of whether you are famous or not. It should be because you love coding.

Even though the featured expectations are getting more lenient these days (I think I might make a topic about this), it used to be like this:
Is your project something new and innovative
Is your project carefully designed to the point you'd like everyone to see it
Is your project not a copy of someone else's, but something you made yourself

If all of these are yes, there's actually a topic on Nominations for Featured!
Just say your Hopscotch username, title of the project, and a link to the project.

Who would like to help me create a Nintendo Switch on Hopscotch?

##But first, some requirements:
1. Need to have at least 1 featured level
2. Need to have been on Hopscotch for at least a summer's worth
3. Reply that you want to sign up! (Because without that, no one will ever know)

Disclaimer: I am very sorry, but not everyone will be able to work on the Nintendo Switch.

_But.._ There will be an unlimited amount of people who can beat test and share ideas!

##People We need:
Software: 1 of 5
Hardware: 2 of 3
Beta Testers: 1 of Unlimited
Idea givers: 1 of Unlimited

• Software: creates the games
• Hardware: created the Switch itself and smoothness it out throughout progress
• Beta Testers: Unlimited, drafts will be sent to you through links
• Idea givers: People who don't have enough time to work on large projects like this, or don't meet requirements. But they are still very much needed

Software: @JonnyGamer @Zachyswag 
Hardware: @Steelhooves @Work_kids_coding 
Beta Testers: @BB-Box 
Idea Givers: @PixelMaster64 

Everyone will be credited for this project!

[details=We'll Mass Tag this]
I have seen people complain about The Mass Tag list currently in use, and we need new guidelines. 

Please, copy directly off of this topic when using the Mass Tag list. It will annoy you, I know, but it will constantly change. 

Here are the new guidelines for adding and using the mass tag list. 

-------


**Add yourself only** Do not add other people to the mass tag list. I'll see all of the edits, so I'll correct you if you added someone else's name, on accident or on purpose. 

---

**Don't use the tag list in all of your topics** We shouldn't be using the mass tag list in every single topic we or another person creates. It is annoying to have to scroll through that, and it doesn't contribute to the discussion.

---

**Always use the current version** Again, people will leave or take their name off of the list. Please always use the current version so we don't have to deal with people getting angry. 

---

**Please don't tamper with this list** It gets annoying when someone destroys something. So please don't tamper with the tag list.
 ---
**Only use this list for things you can contribute to** It gets annoying being tagged for smol potatoes. Things like projects and questions about rules create discussions, things like drawings don't.

---

**Try to put the list in a dropdown folder** The list is getting pretty long, so please try to put in in a folder.

---

**Put the list in the first post, or the one to bring attention to** It's annoying to scroll up just to see what the user wanted you to see, so if you're bringing attention to the topic, put it in the *first post*

---
**Make sure to alphabetise the list** if it's alphabetised, then it's easy to add tags and it can get confusing when in any order (guideline by Periwinkle Dolphin)

---
**Keep the count going** when you add yourself to the list, be sure to increase the number by 1. I just spent all the time counting the tags and not all of them line up with the number (Also by Periwinkle Dolphin)

---
**Mention when you created guideline** people will easily know you did it and know it's your guideline (By Periwinkle Dolphin, again)
---

If you have any other guidelines you would like to have, add them here :wink:

Edit your name to this tag list.

Too many General Topics?,Deprecated (Help with Code),-,No,"Yeah, I understand
I think a better idea would be having separate places on the forum dedicated to coding and inventing, and the other dedicated to communication and being friends. That would make the forum much more organized and friendly

Or maybe when someone creates a post, there would be more choices to what kind of post you're making instead of just ""help with code"", ""collabs"", and ""bugs"". Also, what would make things more interesting, would be if there were tabs at the beginning, just like the ""Latest"", ""New"", and ""Top"" but swapped with the type of topic you are creating

I guess you can just tap the category button, but it's not as nicely laid out as it should be

Do you think it would be possible for Hopscotch to do this, or do you think the Discourse only has one unchangabole layout?

Also, wondering if you like math

<sub> Question 2
[quote=""MR.GAM3R, post:100, topic:34438""]
###The Poisoned Drink Riddle

The King of a small country invites 1000 senators to his annual party. As a tradition, each senator brings the King a bottle of drink. 

Soon after, the Queen discovers that one of the senators is trying to assassinate the King by giving him a bottle of poisoned drink. 

Unfortunately, they do not know which senator, nor which bottle of drink is poisoned, and the poison is completely indiscernible. 

However, the King has 10 prisoners he plans to execute.

 He decides to use them as taste testers to determine which bottle of drink contains the poison. 

The poison when taken has no effect on the prisoner until exactly 24 hours later when the infected prisoner suddenly dies. 

The King needs to determine which bottle of drink is poisoned by tomorrow so that the festivities can continue as planned. 

Hence he only has time for one round of testing.

I Don't Think We Need Topics About Releasing One Project/Is The OMTL Overused/Another Location Warning/Irrelevant Topics [Rants?] (T_T),Random Stuff,-,No,"Yep, here's a long reply:

I think some people agree with this and some people disagree with this. I think some people are annoyed that there are topics on the forum that are clogging the space and making things disorganized (like me). Other people think that it's perfectly ok and the Hopscotch Forum is here so that we can have friendships and do things together. Both of these ideas are perfectly fine, it's just how you communitcate them that makes it not fine

I think this is a great post, but just because one side of the forum believes that this isn't the best idea, doesn't mean they should automatically flag it. They should respond by saying, ""Why do you think that?"" And having a friendly discussion about it. 

Flags are here for a reason, to hide someone's post that was innapropriate, aggressively mean, or personal information. We should not flag if someone is expressing an idea, we should ask them why they think that way. 

-- Main Point -- If they respond rudely or innapropriately, them you can flag. It's not fair to flag someone who's different than you. (I see this happened.. if someone is acting rudely, you can just say it to them. If they don't recognize it, just flag)

How to tap invisible things,Deprecated (Help with Code),-,No,"Yeah, I used to do this, it's very easy to do, but makes the project very messy with objects all over the place

But, there is an easier way to do it without anything visible at all

For example, if you were checking if an object passed a certain point, you could say:

>When (  (object)  x position)  >  ( (Width) / 2 )
     - Change Y by 200


This code let's you have an object move across, and when it gets past a certain point, it moves upwards.
This is much easier than having a character bump a slightly infisible character and then move up, like in this code: (object 2 is the 99% invisible character)

>When game starts
- Set (object 2) position to: (100, (Width/2) )
- Set invisibility to 99%

>When (object) bumps (object 2)
- Change Y by 200

This code is much less efficient and makes your code more buggy. It is much easier for a character to check if it's at a certain X or Y position on a map, and then do something

Hopefully this helped!",4,0,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/how-to-tap-invisible-things/34605/22,2017-04-25 21:01:09 UTC

##Ideas on how categories can be added

Long thought process dead ahead 😅

---

1. We brainstorm Category ideas until he have at least 10 really good ideas.We would submit the 10 really good ideas to you each month.

2. We would revise those ideas on your opinion

3. When ready, we'd take a vote whether or not these ideas would be good. The voting polls would be:
• All ideas are great
• Most ideas are great
• Half the ideas are great
• 3 - 4 ideas are great
• 2 ideas are great
• 1 idea is great
• None are really too great
If we get at least 25-50 people to hit at least 50% of the votes on ""all"" or ""most"" ideas are great, then we could enter the voting stage (if it is lower, then we'd move back to revisions and brainstorming)
We'd enter the voting stage and make a poll with all of the 10 category ideas. We would have a week of the voting period, then the polls will close

4. Then the winning category idea would be turned into a new category, and the process would restart again

We would also have to check with Hopscotch Team, we might not get to do all ideas :blush:

**More thoughts:**

The time it should take for a new category to be added should be around 1 - 2 months or so.

**Depreciating categories**
If we reach to a certain number of categories, we should have a vote on if a certain category is being unused.

This vote would determine if a category will be depreciated into the help with code, or better yet have a depreciated category, with depreciated sub-categories
(Is it possible to have categories within categories?)
Answer: Yeah, just remembered. There are the ""Bugs in Player"" and ""Bugs in Editor"" sub-categories.
The depreciated category should have sub-categories, so we can still have a basis of organization",10,1,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/the-category-idea-topic/34725/2,2017-04-28 21:37:51 UTC

There are infinitely many types of curved lines. Parabola graphs are in:

y = ax^2 + bx^1 + cx^0   =(which is simplified to)=   y = ax^2 + by + c

If you want higher grades of parabolas, you can do:


y = ax^(n) + bx^(n - 1)  +  cx^(n - 2) ...  ...  yx^(2) + zx^(1) + wx^(0)

---
Exponential graphs are in:

y = 2^x

(And you can edit the 2 to any number to make it a higher grade)

---
Circles and ellipses are in:

1 =   (x - h)/(a^2)  +  (y - k)/(b^2)

""h"" is for horizontal movement
""k"" is for kait movement which is vertical
If a = b, then it is a circle. The bigger a and b are, the circle is bigger

So, on a flat surface, the sum of every single triangle's angles will always add up to 180°. On a globe-like surface, the angles will add up to greater than 180°, and on an inverted globe-like surface, it'll add up to less than 180°. 

Also, your answer to the summation of the reversal of all the prime numbers is correct. It diverges to infinity (If a summation reaches to more than 2, it will always diverge to infinity). Surprisingly, the sum of the reversal of all the prime numbers is used in the Reimann Hypothesis.

Since the only one prime ends in a 5, which is 5, there are no other primes less than 100, except for the ones from 50 - 59. 53 and 59 happen to be prime.

(Oh! I forgot I made this! It was such a long time ago)
Too bad I can't move this to the math topic anymore

[details=Detailed Proof]

Yes! I love this! I had showed how to do that to my math teacher and class, but they all got very upset at me. My math teacher said that it was on a curved surface, so it didn't count. Little did I know about Reimannian Geometry which is all about curved surfaces!

I gave then a second proof. If you have 2 parallel lines on a graph, they can still reach each other at infinity. What I mean is that they are at an infinitesimally small angle, so that they will never be any closer to each other (until they reach infinity). We can prove this with this mind bending stantement:

Does 0.999.. = 1?

1/3 = 0.333..
3(1/3) = 3(0.333..)
3/3 = 0.999..

And we know that 3/3 = 1, so..

1 = 0.999..

So now 0.000..1 = 0. A line having that angle will never move until it reaches infinity.

Ian Stewart's books and the Wtmad in 4D have a ton of puzzles and fun things like that. Plus, they are long books too (4D has like 200+ pages) so it will last very long

Hey, you look like you love math, do you want to put this in the Numberphile Topic or the Give Each other Math Questions Topic? That would be great! And yes, I have an answer to your solution. (Also, more people go in and out of those threads)

(I'll provide links in a moment)

[details=Answer]
Factorials are an interesting thing. 10! Would be 1*2*3...8*9*10.

Factorials have Name divisors, hence also being called antiprimes or extremely composite numbers

1000! Have a good plenty amount of divisors. We will branch all of the numbers multiplied together into their factors. Then we'll have a perfect factor.

2
3
4 = 2, 2
5
6 = 2, 3
7
9 = 3, 3
10 = 2, 5
11
12 = 2, 2, 3
13
14 = 2, 7

You get the main idea here. I have school to do and will answer this completely later

Look, I honestly don't care whether you know calculus, or are learning in second grade. I don't care at all. I don't care what level math you are, but I do care how you treat other people. Just because you feel like your better than someone or have a prejudice still doesn't mean you can blow up in their face and tell them they aren't smart. That's not how it works. Also, every person who has autism that I know are all extreeeemely smart. So what you said doesn't make sense, it is plain mean. If you feel like you can target a specific group of people or be rude and obnoxious, this forum isn't for you. If you want to stay, just get along with people. Make friends and talk about math. It makes everyone a lot happier and is honestly more fun. Don't waste your time on things that don't matter, you should be smarter than that, you said so yourself. If your extremely smart and can solve famous math problems, but don't care about people and are rude, nobody will care that your smart they'll care about how you treat people.

Sorry, kind of got off on a rant there. But it's true. You need to be kind to people whether or not your smarter than them.

Last last last last last, being mean to people just because they have autism or whatever is a veeeery important topic to me right now. My younger brother is dealing with things of the like, but it doesn't make him unsmart. In fact, on an IQ test that went to 180, he scored a perfect 180. He's wicked smart, but he still has some issues he needs help with. But barely any of it is math. Ok I'm done.

[details=Here was BAS's:]

Math isn't a competition. When you say things like that, you don't come off as intelligent, but simply very snarky. Everyone is at a different level here mathematically, but the thing about math is that it isn't about what you know. I don't care if you've learned functions, or can apply the binomial theorem, or know a lot of lambda calculus. It doesn't make you a good mathematician. What makes a good mathematician is problem solving skill - and that is why people were able to connect on this topic at drastically different levels of skill.
Discouraging that is a very bad thing.

maybe there are more things that people know and might share :upside_down:
[/quote]

We should probably create a topic specifically for types of maths used (for example the FRACTAN and other types of topics like Reimannian Geometry or Flexagons). It would be awesome if people added their ideas and tools for specific ideas instead of needing to separate topics for ideas that not many people know about. A teaching topic might actually be pretty nice

JonnyGamer and t1's Math Blog!,Math,-,No,"The Golden ratio blog post:

By @t1_hopscotch – and @JonnyGamer (you can just add to this like normal whenever like it is yours too! :D)

- The Golden Ratio is equal to `(1 + √5)/2 : 1` , which is approximately `1.618... : 1`. The number is also known as phi Φ, a letter of the Greek alphabet (like how pi π is also a letter of the Greek alphabet, and phi rhymes with pi).

 - (it's a matter of opinion), but shapes using the Golden Ratio for measurements are thought to be aesthetically pleasing, hence the name. e.g. a rectangle with its side lengths in the Golden Ratio, with the longer side 1.618 in comparison to the shorter side is known as a golden rectangle.

- If you take any two consequential Fibonacci numbers and divide the smaller one into the larger one, as the Fibonacci numbers grow larger, it will get closer and closer to the golden ratio!

- if you add 1 to phi you get its square, and if you subtract 1 from phi you get its reciprocal (recipocral is when you divide 1 by a number)

Challenge Math and Brain Teaser Problems!,Math,-,No,"This has to do with triangle, numbers! Awesome!

[details=All about triangle numbers]
This is a great question, and has to do a lot with triangle numbers!
First, I'll explain what they are: a triangle number is like a factorial (n!), but instead of multpliyong together all the previous numbers, you add them together.

There's a formula for finding triangular numbers, which is derived form the patter of 1, 1 + 2, 1 + 2 + 3, ...
It follows a right triangle using dots (I'll provide a link for this!)

n * ( n + 1 )
  –––––––
       2

---

Now that we are talking about it, this is why square numbers are called square! It makes a square pattern when you increase which gives you the formula:

n*n

---

Also! A square number can be trianglular! Can you find any examples?? :slight_smile:

--- 

Lastly, there are numbers such as pentagonal, hexagonal, septagonal, ... , myriagonal!
Here's links to these that explain them better:

Just because there's a new law saying they can't use guns, and they don't follow the laws anyway, they're not going to follow this one either

[details=OMTL]
First, this topic was *not* my idea. But @PopTart0219 left and people are using outdated OMTLs. I believe I got an updated version.

#GUIDELINES:
**Do not overuse** - Use it once per subject, and *only use it in general topics* ***for new projects***.(only once a month for gen topics)

**Use it in the post you want people to see** - Nobody likes scrolling. Well, some people do.

**Only use it for things you can contribute to** - Something something don't tag for smol potatoes.

**Put it in a details folder** - Put an empty line before the details folder.

**Keep the count going** - Increase the count when you add yourself, decrease it when you remove yourself.

**Don't tamper with the list** - It's annoying when someone messes it up. 

**Keep the list in alphabetical order** - This is a semi new tradition, making it easier to remove yourself.

**Remove yourself if you leave** There is a limit of 150 tags, so remove yourself so you don't waste tags

I missed a lot of guidelines, I think, so please put in any you can remember.

#HOW TO USE
Quote this, select all and cut.
Open a text editor and paste. Remove [/quote] and everything above the list. Select all, cut and paste on your topic.

Alternatively, quote this, select all and remove [/quote] and everything above the list. Select all, cut and paste on your topic.

If you are using a computer, you can quote and select just the list (click on one end of the list, and shift+click the other end), cut and paste on your topic.

Select the text of whichever &uarr; quote you prefer, and then press the **Quote** button that pops up over your selection – or the **Reply** button at the bottom of this post.

Below the quote, type a word or two about why you picked that one, because I’m curious :thinking:

The Category Idea Topic,Meta - Forum,-,No,"Thanks! Yeah, my original idea was to probably do a vote every month, but that seems to short of a time.

Long thought process: <sub>
hehe 😂 

1. We brainstorm Category ideas until he have at least 10 really good ideas. We would submit the 10 really good ideas to you each month.

2. We would revise those ideas on your opinion

3. When ready, we'd take a vote whether or not these ideas would be good. The voting polls would be:
     • All ideas are great
• Most ideas are great
• Half the ideas are great
• 3 - 4 ideas are great
• 2 ideas are great
• 1 idea is great
• None are really too great

4. If we get at least 25-50 people to hit at least 50% of the votes on ""all"" or ""most"" ideas are great, then we could enter the voting stage (if it is lower, then we'd move back to revisions and brainstorming)

5. We'd enter the voting stage and make a poll with all of the 10 category ideas. We would have a week of the voting period, then the polls will close

6. Then the winning category idea would be turned into a new category, and the process would restart again

---

More thoughts:

The time it should take for a new category to be added should be around 1 - 2 months or so. 

Depreciating categories
If we reach to a certain number of categories, we should have a vote on if a certain category is being unused. 

This vote would determine if a category will be depreciated into the help with code, or better yet have a depreciated category, with depreciated sub-categories
(Is it possible to have categories within categories?)
Answer: Yeah, just remembered. There are the ""Bugs in Player"" and ""Bugs in Editor"" sub-categories.

The depreciated category should have sub-categories, so we can still have a basis of organization

The Numberphile Topic -- The Official Nerdy Math Topic! [OLD],Math,-,No,"**More about terms**

Writing a function can have infinitely many terms:

But let's start with just the first term, which is the constant
5

If 5 were out only term, it's just like saying: 5 * (x^0)
To simplify that to 5:
1. we take (x^0) = 1 (anything to the power of zero is 1)
2. 5 * 1 = 5

---

If we have 2 terms, for example:
5x + 5

That's exactly like saying:
5(x^1) + 5(x^0)

As you can see, the more terms we add, the more the ""powered"" values on the ""x"" go up.

That's just the basics of terms, I'll type more on this

##Guidlines for the OMTL <sub> <sub> Feel free to edit

---
**Do not overuse** - Use it once per subject, and not in General Topics. For other cases, see below.

**Use it in the post you want people to see** - Nobody likes scrolling. Well, some people do.

**Only use it for things you can contribute to** - Something something don't tag for smol potatoes.

**Don't tamper with the list** - It's annoying when someone messes it up.

**Remove yourself if you leave** - There is a limit of 150 tags, so remove yourself so you don't waste tags

Other cases:

- **Join the @POMTL** - This Tag List can be used in General Topics for new projects. People in this list are signed up to help with ideas and suggestions for said projects

- **Sign up for your own custom group** with forum friends for notices in your general topic, rather than using the OMTL.

**Here's my Hopscotch History:**

About my dad:
This all starts with my dad, around 15 he really wanted to learn how to code video games. He had got to the mall arcades and wanted to copy and invent some creations of his own! He spent a lot of time reading programming manuels and his dad bought him a computer. He made top selling games like MacGolf (which was the first 3D game on the Mac and was the top selling game for 5 years!). He's worked at many programming companies like Adobe (invented the history pallets for photoshop), Microsoft, and Apple. But now he has settled down at an epic Artificial Intelligence start up called AYASDI whose main focus is on improving health care and securing bank transactions.

How my dad introduced me to coding:
Once my dad heard a few years ago that I had passed all of the Hour of Code challenges (there weren't too many back then.. 😂), he decided to show me this great new app called Hopscotch! This was in August 2014 (or 2013!) and the Holloween Update was there so all the characters were dressed up in Halloween costumes (I didn't know why, though. It was very confusing at the time). Once he showed me the app, he created mini programming challenges for me which I would do (One of them was to create a spiral, but I hadn't grasped the concept of Variables at the time, so I peeked at his code 😂). A little while later, Hopscotch created the Community, which was very basic to what we have now. There was the newest section and most liked section (I think something else too..). They had finally created profiles and I could ""Star"" other people's projects as well. Seeing amazing projects made by the community and  sing inspired,I decided that Hopscotch was an amazing place for me to stay on (Funky63 and T1's projects were epic).

My first Collab:
After some time of doodling around (and a failed attempt to make a Space Invaders game without knowing how to use Variables and without ""When"" Blocks for bumping), my friends and I, who were in 6th grade at the time, decided to create a Flappybird Gamecenter Arcade (This was like 3-4 years ago)

- [Type 1](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/s4qlpaq)
- [Type 2](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/hacj3pi) — Made this one by myself

This idea eventually lead to my first featured project, but more on that later: [Flappimoji!](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/xkep63v1l)

Learning how to use Variables:
One of my friends finally helped me learn how to use variables, and they did that by creating a simple button joystick. At the time, if you were editing a certain character, you couldn't make it move when a different character was tapped. When the other character was tapped, set a variable to 1. When the variable is 1, the original character moves a certain direction and sets the variable back to 0. This is how we had to make joysticks

Progression:
Once I learned variables, I went into creating an idea called ""Flip it"" later called ""Gravity Cube"". I'll add all of my updates below.. or you can find them down near the bottom of my profile in Hopscotch. I had unknowingly based this off of the AppStore game called Gravoty Duck (it's an amazing game!). After a few more tests, I created a Projects called: How to create a Simple Flip Game v1.2 ([How to make a simple flip game v1.2](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/-vjhgov)). At this time, the community had a ""How To's"" section! When I published this project, it was put on there right next to the ""How to get the emoji keyboard"" project (maybe by Kiwicute??). I was extremely proud of this moment and was the main reason I have stayed since then. That project got 350 likes or something

Experimenting:
Once I had gotten to Update 1.7, I decided to experiment some things ([Flip it v1.7](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/jugdyck)) – (Sorry, the character moves way too fast! This is because I was using an iPad 3 at the time and my code had become really laggy. I sped up the movement to make it less slow, but on newer iPad's it because waaaay to fast).

I experimented with invisibilities and shading. My dad told my that this concept was invented by Apple and was used in their software and mainly iPhoto (He worked on the iPhoto team for Apple at the time). ([Shading Ideas](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/byfmayy)) When you notice I used rectangle blocks, these are not the same rectangle characters that Hopscotch used now. I hand picked them using Unicode characters, where you can copy these from the geometric shapes section here: ([Unicode Wikipediia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters))

Let's go back a few weeks.. I was also experimenting with emoji's making some sort of Stop Motion animation. I had seen some projects use emoji's to ""speak"" but you couldn't distinguish what they were saying. I friend to make this as realistic as pissobls and ended up making a few words: ([How to make Emoji's ""Speak""](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/s6kx0lm)) ( I had later, when sounds was added, I tried doing it with sounds, but utterly failed and gave up 😂)

I also experimented with some update ideas, which I actually got a response from @Asha! ([Hopscotch Update Idea](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/r2etrat))

I also created my first pixel art in this phase. Took FOREVER.. ([Link](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/owop7uy))

Coding Phase:
After experimenting for some weeks, I decided to enter a coding phase. This was my most proud time, which was where I created loads of ideas and also had a bunch of time on my hands.

Music:
I then got into creating music for people. I entered @MagmaPOP's 3D Minecraft competition for music! I had created a song, but it was too long.. 😂

Song for @Day_Dreamer – [Link!](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/xrtxy47dq) 

After I made this last song, Funky63 got really upset at the Community and deleted all of his projects.. It was a dark period for me since my main inspired left. He did eventually return, though. I ended up making this game called ""Bit Bord"". It only used 1 text and clones. It took me a while to create – [Bit Bird Link](https://c.gethopscotch.com/p/xsf399kr2)

After I made this game called, ""Radius"", I went into an inactive spurt on my own account. That's because I went to a new account called Quantum9! I also joined my first collab called ""Anime Art"" (Hosted by @Hermione) . I drew some pictures there that I was really proud of. They got deleted though, by a hacker.. One got liked by MagmaPOP, though!!

Pictures:

Quantum9 was an account I created just for mathematical tests, and basically the account I used to learn Sin and Cosine. I made a few awesome projects over there, feel free to check them out! (I'll add more about this)

Eventually, 8th grade had arrived (last year) and I had to turn in my iPad. I made a goodbye project and I felt really bad for leaving Hopscotch. I could code, however, on a different iPad 3, but it was extremely slow. My Dad thankfully bought me a new iPad at the beginning of summer for High School, but I was still very inactive. Not until the start of this summer did I become active again. I created a new account called ""Super Mario Mini Games"". I made this account with my younger brother and also got the subscription. We made a few featured projects on there, but I have become inactive again (except I am making a few secret projects.. 😏). I have become extremely active on the forum and finally have gotten Regular! Yay! I do think, that I will graduate Hopscotch soon and will design apps using JavaScript and Python. I will however always stay on the forum and talk about math! Thanks for reading, everyone!

I was thinking of trying to make a quantum computer in Hopscotch (It may not actually be possible, but it'd be really fun to work on!)

Here's an explanation video by Kurzgesagt (I've been watching his YouTube recently)

Anyway, I was wondering how Qubits would work in Hopscotch, since they can be 0 and 1 at the same time. Hopscotch is Turing complete, so I guess this would technically be feasible.. Maybe

**Hints to who the hacker is**
<img src=""/uploads/default/original/3X/c/0/c00931ce3400de875be4ef51410fa78558bfb24c.jpg"" width=""281"" height=""499"">


Key is qwertyertyui
That's not an actual key
But it is. It is just missing...a space
By the way, I am Cieli, Fa
My avatar is a Hotdog
That is my riddle account

 UPDATE-
Basically, using this hint and
CielingFan hotdog no space I.E. switch
CielingFan hotdog I.E. replacement

Her account is CielingFan. There are two hackers who hacked, the lead hacker who once was Enigma/Snake of Ice, which changed her name to Oribi Jaguar Blue Winfx and the second hacker, who's alias used to be Mysterious Queen, and whose current alias is Shadowslayer. There is also a third new apprentice, whose current alias is Pidgeypodged, aka MistyMystery. Misty is @HappyDolphin and trains 2 apprentices, Frog Space and FidgetFish. 

The hackers host the trials on the CielingFan account. We finished them. Now Oribi Jaguar Blue Winfx is the head of Hopscotch Hacker Association (HHA). FrogSpace, Snoo, and Soapysuds are also in the HHA. 

We don't know much of OribiJaguarBlueWinfx. All that we know is that she hacked several collabs and personal accounts, left HS, and is very smart. She apparently likes ""Daytripper"", by the Beatles. And she plays the guitar. She's also a friend of FearlessPhoenix, and is possibly the creator of her fan account. Oribi has gotten several features, too.

[details=Commentary]
It seems as though that the Game Changers List are made up of very old projects. This is not bad, as Game Changers are the projects that inspire us, but there haven't been any newly “inspiring” projects or creators. Also, most projects do not use “new” updates like the sound and image updates. Should the Hopscotch Team add more to this list? Or should there be a different idea for this..

One idea is the “Best project of the month”
This would be a list of Hopscotch’s favorite project made within a month. This helps new projects to be recognized more often.

Another idea related to this is “Best creators (of the month)”
This would show the top 10 creators of the month, and how it would work is a “Likes to Project” ratio. This means that, if a creator has created a lot of projects that have a lot of likes, they'd be on the top 10 list. If one person seems to be dominating the list, they could be put in the “Hall of Fame” which would show the best creators and also best projects that have been made (so combined with the Game Changers section)

Although these are closely related to “Featured” and “Trending”, these may be able to take the place of them as a better alternative. But we would still be able to keep sections like “Rising” and “Starter projects”

One last thing: 
We should bring back the How-To’s section (Start Projects seems to be pretty good, though)
We should create an art section: All popular projects underneath the “art” section would be put in a “best art” category. The same could go for other sections like a “best game” or “best idea” or “best challenge” or “best movie” etc.

[/details]

---

**Summing everything up:**

“Best Projects of the Month” section
“Top Ten Creators” section
“Hall of Fame” section
“Best: ‘___’” section <sub> (Best Artwork, best game, best challenge, best movie)

Ooh! 3 more years! Sooo clooose

<sub> Being a Hopscotch Mod might actually be really fun! I've been considering it a lot",3,1,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/mod-faqs-official-topic/36296/26,2017-06-27 04:48:34 UTC
Game Changers: How could it be changed,Meta - Hopscotch,-,No,"**Wow! Thanks for taking the time of writing all of that out! It really means a lot!**

Here are some more ideas about this:

---

**Competition:**
Yeah, I've realized a lot of this could potentially add a lot of competition. Maybe if there was a way to somehow change the perspective on that by showing off individual Hopscotchers. I noticed that half of the Game Changers projects were made by 10 Hopscotchers, and the other half were all individually made. If there was a way to feature individual stuff, that'd be great. So once you're recognized on it, then your done and other people have a chance at being recognized.

Another thing is people's talent and/or exposure. For talent (back to the Game Changers) a lot of them were made by really talented people (Which they deserve to be recognized for, because their projects are great). If there was a way in which less talented people could get more exposure to their code, that'd be great. The Rising section was a perfect idea, except THT started using it less and instead used the Featured section. I've noticed that a few projects were put on the Rising list, that's great.

**Remodeling the Featured List:**
Since ""Feature worthy"" projects and ""Rising worthy"" projects have been intermingled in the ""Featured"" tab, I was thinking about making an improved version of it. I'm still brainstorming ideas about this, so yeah

If Hopscotch put up they're favorite project of the month, this would drive people to create something or invent something and spend a lot of time doing so. Maybe even they could do their ""Top 10"" or ""Highlights"" of the month, but it would drive a lot of healthy competition (People would have motive to create something really high quality)

However, due to something like THT not seeing someone's project, it could be a real downer. If there were specific people looking out for projects like this, that'd be great. But it would be hard to find people willing to do that.

I remember back when the Community started, all of the projects I saw were amazing and people spent a lot of time creating them. There were no chat rooms or spam projects, it was all high quality things people were proud to have published (The texting update idea seems pretty good to implement because of this, but it might take a while to create something like that. Maybe only people with subscription can text, but then the majority of people who don't might still create spam projects.. this is tough!)

Hopscotch Compared to other Coding Places (Conversation),Meta - Hopscotch,-,No,"Yeah, I've heard of those coding cites. But at that point it seems like learning JavaScript would be much more useful. Hopscotch is great for beginners, but Scratch and Tynker seem a little but more advanced and less friendly to use.

(Hopscotch has the nice iOS 7-ey feel to it, less skeuomorphic)

But since it's only for iOS it's harder to get a lot of people working on it.

Hey guy! I'm JonnyGamer new to the Forum, but not in hopscotch.

You could also ask for help with it to popular hopscotchers. The text button would be really great.

[details=Dude! I found the script! Sorry for the swears in it, though..]

you're on a rock floating in space.

pretty cool, huh?

some of it's water.

fuck it, actually most of it's water.

i can't even get from here to there without buying a boat.

it's sad.

i'm sad.

i miss you.

how did this happen?

a long time ago, actually never, and also now, nothing is nowhere.

when?

never.

makes sense, right?

like i said, it didn't happen.

nothing was never anywhere.

that's why it's been everywhere.

it's been so everywhere you don't need a where.

you don't even need a when.

that's how every it gets.

forget this.

i wanna be something.

go somewhere.

do something.

i want things to change.

i want to invent time and space.

and i know it's possible because everything is here and it probably already happened.

i just don't know when to start.

and that's exactly where it started.

whoah, i paused it.

i think there's a universe now.

what's it made of?

quarks & stuff

ah, that's a thing.

in a place.

don't like it?

try a new place.

at a different time™.

try to stick together, because the world is gonna get bigger.

and emptier.

but it's not empty yet.

it's still very full, and about a kjghpillion degrees.

great news!

the quarks are now happily married, in groups of three called a proton or a neutron

and there's something else flying around too that wants to join in but can't cause it's still too

HOT
great news!

the protons and neutrons are now happily married to each other.

and some of them even doubled up.

great news, the electrons have now joined in

congratulations, the world is now a bunch of gas in space.

but it's getting closer together.

and it's getting closer together.

and it's getting closer toge-

it's a star

new shit just got made!

some stars burn out and die.

bigger stars burn out and die with passion, and make some brand new, way crazier shit.

space dust

which allows newer, more interesting stars to be made, and then die, and explode into

even crazier space dust

so now stars have cool stuff around them, like rocks, ice, and funny clouds, which can make some very interesting things.

like this ball of flaming rocks for example.

holy shit, we just got hit with another ball of flaming rocks.

and it kind of made a mess.

which is

now the moon

weather update:

it's raining rocks from outer space.

weather update:

those rocks might have had water inside them, and now there's hot steam in the sky.

weather update:

cooler temperatures today, and the floor is no longer lava.

weather update:

it's raining.

severe flooding alert:

the entire world is now an ocean.

volcano alert:

that's land!

there's life in the ocean

what?

something's alive in the ocean

oh cool, like a plant or an animal?

no, a microscopic speck.

it lives at the bottom of the ocean and eats chemical soup, which is being served hot and fresh, made from gnarly space ingredients left over from when it was raining rocks or whatever.

oh yeah, and it can do that.

it has secret instructions written inside itself telling it how to build another one of itself.

so that's pretty nifty, i would say.

tired of living at the bottom of the ocean?

now you can eat sunlight!

using a revolutionary technique, you can convert sunlight into food

taste the sun

side effect: now there's oxygen everywhere and the sky's blue.

then the earth might have been a snowball for a while, maybe even a couple of times.

it's a sponge.

it's a plant.

it's a worm, and some other types of weird strange water bugs and strange fish.

it's the Cambrian explosion

""wow, that's animals and stuff""

but we're still in the ocean, hey, can we go on land?

no

why?

the sun is a deadly lazer

oh okay.

not anymore, there's a blanket

now the animals can go on land.

come on, animals, let's go on land!

nope, can't walk yet.

and there's no food yet, so i don't care.

ok, will you learn to walk if there's plants up here?

maybe, said some bugs, and fish.

ok, so i can go on land, but i have to go back in the water to

have babies

learn to use an egg.

i was already doing that.

use a stronger egg.

put water in it.

have a baby, on land, in an egg.

water is in the egg.

baby, in the egg, in the water, in the egg.

works for me.

bye bye ocean

and now everything's huge.

including bugs.

wanna see a map of the land?

sure.

oh fuck, now everything's dead.

just kidding, here are the survivors.

keep your eye on this one because it's about to become the dinosaurs.

here's another map of the land.

yeah, it broke apart, don't worry about it, it does that all the time.

here comes a meteor.

and the dinosaurs are gone

it's mammal time, here come the mammals.

look at those breasts.

now they're gonna dominate the world and one of them just learned how to grab stuff.

and walk.

no, like, walk like that.

and grab stuff at the same time.

and bang rocks together to make pointed rocks.

""ouch""

and set things on fire.

""yeouch""

and make crazy sounds with their voice.

""gneurshk""

which can mean different things.

that's a human person

and now they're everywhere.

almost.

ice age

what, you can walk over here?

cool.

not anymore

well i guess we're stuck here now.

let's review.

there's people on the planet.

and they're chasing their food.

fuck it, time to plant some grass.

look at this.

i control the food now.

now everyone will want to be my friend and live near me.

let's all build houses except mine is bigger because i own the food.

this is great, i wonder if anyone else is doing this.

tired of using rocks for everything?

use metal.

it's underground.

better farming was just invented, in a sweet dank valley right in between these two rivers.

and the animals are helping.

guess what happens next

more food.

and more people who came to buy the food.

now you need people to help make the food and keep track of the sales.

and now you need houses for people to live in and people to make the houses, and now there's more people and they invent things, which makes things better and more people come and there's more farming and more people to make more things for more people and now there's business, money, writing, laws, power.

Society

coming soon to a dank river valley near you.

meanwhile, out in the middle of nowhere, the horse is probably being tamed.

why is all my metal so lame and lumpy?

tired of using lame, sad metal?

introducing

Bronze

made with special ingredient tin from the far lands of tin land.

i don't know, my dealer won't tell me where he gets it.

also, guess what?

egypt

meanwhile, out in the middle of nowhere, they figured out how to put wheels on a horse.

now we're getting somewhere.

also

china

and did i mention

indus river valley civilization

norte chico

the middle east is getting more complicated, maybe because it's in the middle of the east.

knock knock, er, clop clop.

it's the people with the horses.

and they made an empire.

and then everyone else copied their horses.

greeks

ah look, it must be the greeks, er, a beta version of the greeks.

let's check in with the indus river valley civilization.

they're gone.

guess who's not gone?

china

new arrivals in india, maybe it's those horse people i was talking about, or their cousins or something

and they wrote some hymns and mantras and stuff

you could make a religion out of this.

there's the bronze age collapse.

now the phoenicians can get down to business

also, can we switch to a metal that's a little easier to find?

thanks.

look who came back to israel, it's the twelve tribes of israel.

and they believe in God

just 1 though, he's got like a ten step program.

here's some huge heads.

must be the olmecs.

the phoenicians make some colonies.

the greeks copy their idea and make some colonies.

the phoenicians made a colony so big it makes colonies.

here comes the assyrian empire.

never mind, it's the babylonian- median-

it's the Persian Empire

""wow, that's big""

ah, the buddha was just enlightened.

who's the buddha?

this guy, who sat under a tree for so long that he figured out how to ignore the fact that we're all dying.

you could make a religion out of this.

oops, china just broke, but while it was breaking, confucius was figuring out how to have good morals.

ah, the greeks just had the idea of thinking about stuff.

and right over here, alexander just had the idea of conquering the entire persian empire.

it's a great idea.

he was great.

and now he's dead.

hopefully the rest of the gang will be able to share the empire evenly between them.

knock knock, it's chandragupta, he says get the hell out of here.

will you get the hell out of here if i give you 500 elephants?

ok thanks, bye

time to conquer all of india

or

most of india

but what about this part?

that's the tamil kings, no one conquers the tamil kings.

who are the tamil kings?

merchants, probably

and they've got spices

who would like to buy the spices?

me, said the arabians, swiftly buying it and selling it to the rest of the world.

hey, china put itself back together again, with good morals as their main philosophy.

actually, they have three main philosophies.

out here, the horse nomads run wild and free, and they would like to ransack your city.

let's check the greekification levels of the greekified kingdoms.

greekification overload!

bye, said the parthians.

bye, said the jews.

hi, said the parthians, taking over the entire place.

heyyyyyyyy, said the romans, eating the entire mediterranean for breakfast.

thanks for invading our homeland, said the jews, who were starting to get tired of people invading their homeland.

hi, everything's great, said some guy who seems to be getting very popular and is then arrested and killed for being too popular, which only makes him more popular.

you could make a religion out of this.

want silk?

now you can buy it from china.

they just made a

brand new road to the world

or you can

get there on water

sick! new trade routes! said india, accidentally spreading their religion to the entire southeast.

hmm, that's a good place for an epic trading kingdom.

there goes buddhism traveling up the silk road.

i wonder if it'll reach china before it collapses again.

remember the persian empire?

yep, said the persians, making a new one.

axum is getting so powerful they would like to build a long stick.

has anyone populated madagascar yet?

let's do it together.

china is whole again

then it broke again

still can't cross the sahara desert?

try camels.

hell yeah! now we've got business

said the ghana empire, selling lots of gold, and slaves

hi, i live in the roman empire, and i was wondering

is loving jesus legal yet?

no.

actually, ok, sure, said constantine, moving the capital way over here to be closer to his

main rival

don't worry about rome, it won't fall.

it's the golden age of india

there's the gupta empire, not chandragupta, just gupta.

first name chandra.

the first.

guess who's in rome?

barbarians

what's a barbarian?

non-romans, said the romans, being invaded by non-romans.

r.i.p., roman empire, er, actually just half of it, the other half is just fine, but it's not in rome anymore so let's give it a new name.

the mayans have figured out the stars

oh and here's a huge city, population: everyone

the göktürks have taken over the entire eurasian steppe.

great job, göktürks.

how's india?

broken.

how's china?

back together

how's those trading kingdoms?

bigger, and there's more of them

korea has 3 kingdoms.

japan has a kingdom, it's the sunrise kingdom.

deep in the arabian desert, on the top of a mountain, the real god whispers in muhammed's ear.

so he goes down to the cube where everyone worships gods and he tells them their gods are all fake.

and everyone got so mad at him that he had to leave town and go to a different town.

you could make a religion out of this.

and maybe conquer the world as well.

the roman empire is long gone, but somehow the pope is still the pope.

plus there's

new kingdoms all over europe

i wonder if there's room for moors.

here's all the wisdom.

in a house.

it's the baghdad house of wisdom.

just in time for the

islamic golden age

let's bring stuff to the coast and sell it, and become the swahili on the swahili coast, said the swahili on the swahili coast.

remember this tiny space you have to go through to get from here to there?

someone owns that now.

wanna get enlightened in the middle of nowhere?

the franks have the biggest kingdom in europe, and the pope is so proud that he invites the king over for christmas.

surprise! you're the new roman emperor, said the pope, pretending to still be part of the roman empire.

then the franks broke their kingdom into what will later be called france and not france.

but the northerners, or just norse if you don't have much time, are exploring.

they go north, from the north to the northern north.

and they find some land.

two types of land.

and they name them accordingly.

they also invade some other places, and get called many names, such as vikings.

there's the rus.

the kievan rus.

are they vikings?

i don't think so, said the kievan rus.

ok, fair enough.

the pope is ready to make some more emperors.

of the ""roman empire"".

the holy roman empire.

it's actually germany but don't worry about it.

new kingdoms.

christianize all the kingdoms

which brand would you like?

mine's better.

mine's better.

mine's better.

time to conquer england, said william.

it's a bird, it's a plane

it's the seljuk turks

aah! said the byzantine empire who's getting so small and almost doesn't exist anymore.

we need help!

they need help, so they call the pope.

hey pope, can you help us get rid of the seljuks?

maybe take back the holy land on the way?

come on, i know you want to take back the holy land.

yes, i do actually want to do that.

let's do a crusade.

crusade

they did many crusades, some of which almost didn't fail.

but at least the italians got some sweet trade deals.

goodbye mayans.

hello toltecs

goodbye toltecs.

hello mississippi

look at those mounds.

there's the pueblo.

i always wondered how to build a town in a cliff.

guess who's here?

khmer.

where?

here.

and pagan is there.

vietnam unconquered itself, korea just became itself, and japan is so addicted to art that the military might have to take over the government.

china just invented bombs, and typing.

and the mongols just invaded most of the universe.

nice going, Genghis!

i bet that will last a long time.

some of the islamic turks were unaffected by the mongol invasions because they were busy invading india.

is it tonga time?

i think it's tonga time.

i just found out where the swahili gets all their gold.

look at this chad.

means ""lake"".

there's an empire there.

right in the middle of

Africa

the king of mali is so rich he's going on tour to let everyone know.

wow, that guy's rich, everyone said.

the christians are doing a great job reconquering iberia, which will soon be called spain and not spain.

please remain christian.

we will check in later to see if you're still christian when you least expect.

whoops, half of europe just died.

ming

china's back, yay!

hey khmer, time to share.

new kingdoms here and there.

oh, look who controls all the islands.

it's the mahajapit.

majahapit.

mapajahit.

mahapajit.

mapajahit.

majapahit?

oh, italy's really rich, time for them to care a lot about art and the ancient classics.

it's kinda like a rebirth.

here's a printer.

let's make books.

so you think you can conquer the byzantine empire?

yep, said the ottoman turks.

nice job, ottoman turks.

whoops, you missed a spot.

don't forget to ban europe from the indian spice trade.

what? that's bullshit, said portugal, spiceless.

well i guess we'll have to find another way to india

wait! said christopher columbus, probably smoking crack.

if the world is round, let's go this way to india.

nah, don't worry, we already got this, said portugal.

so chris goes to spain.

hey spain, wanna hire me to find india by going around back of the world?

no.

please?

no.

please?

no.

please?

ok.

so he sails into the ocean.

and discovers more ocean.

and then discovers the indies.

and japan.

let's draw a line to decide who gets which half of the world.

the aztec and inca empires are off to a great start.

i wonder if they know that europe just discovered their continent?

the habsburgs are marrying into so many royal families they might have to start marrying each other.

move over lithuania, here comes moscow.

ivan wants to make russia great again.

move over timurids, maybe go invade india or something.

persia just made persia persian again.

let's make it the other kind of islam.

the one where we thought the first guy should have been the other guy.

hey christians!

do you sin?

now you can buy your way out of hell.

that's bullshit.

this whole thing is bullshit.

that's a scam.

fuck the church.

here's 95 reasons why, said martin luther, in his new book, which might have accidentally started the protestant reformation.

you know what would be magnificent, said suleiman, wearing an onion hat?

what if the ottoman empire was really big?

which it is now.

what if russia was big? said ivan, trying not to be terrible.

portugal had a dream that they controlled the entire indian ocean, including the spice trade.

and then that dream was real.

and spain realized that this is not india, but they pillaged it anyway.

damn, said england and france.

we gotta start pillaging some stuff.

then the dutch revolt and all the hipsters move to amsterdam.

damn, said amsterdam.

we gotta start pillaging some stuff.

question 1: can you get to india through north america?

no, but at least there's beaver.

question 2: steal the spice trade.

that's not a question, but the dutch did it anyway.

sugar

guess where all the sugar's made?

in brazil.

stolen

and the caribbean.

and it's so god damn profitable you might forget to not do slavery.

the next thing on russia's to-do list is to get bigger.

britain and france are having a friendly discussion about who should control the entire world.

more specifically, ohio.

then it escalates into a seven year discussion, giving prussia a chance to show austria who's boss.

but what about britain and france, did they figure out who's boss?

yes they did.

it's britain.

guess who's broke?

also britain.

so they start taxing the hell out of america.

fuck you, says america, declaring their independence, and fighting for it.

and france helps them win, now france is broke.

and britain'll have to send their prisoners to a different continent.

wait, if france is broke, why do the king and queen still wear such fancy dresses?

let's overthrow the palace and cut all their heads off! said robespierre, cutting everybody's head off until someone eventually got mad and cut his head off.

you could make a reli- no, don't.

haiti is staring to like the idea of a revolution.

especially the slaves, who free themselves by killing their masters.

why didn't we think of this before?

wait, who's in charge of france now?

me

said napoleon, trying to take over europe.

luckily, they banished him to an island.

but he came back

luckily, they banished him to another island.

there goes latin america, becoming independent in the latin american wars of independence.

britain just figured out how to turn steam into power.

so now they can make

many different types of machines and factories with machines in them so they can make a lot of products real fast

then they invent some trains.

and conquer india and maybe put some trains there.

hey, china! said britain.

buy stuff from us!

nah dude, we already got everything, says china.

so britain tried to get them addicted to opium.

which worked, actually.

but then china made it illegal and dumped it all into the sea.

so britain threw a hissy fit, and made them open up five cities and give them an island.

britain and russia are playing a game where they try to stop each other from conquering afghanistan.

also, the

sultan of oman lives in zanzibar now

""that's just where he lives""

india just had a revolution, and they would like to govern themselves now.

nope, said britain, governing them even harder than before.

technology is about to go crazy

the united states finally figured out whether slavery is good or bad.

it's bad, they decided.

and then they continued manifesting their destiny, which is to kill the rest of the natives and take their land and maybe kick out the mexicans too.

i know, let's rape africa, said europe, scrambling to see who could rape it the fastest.

they never got ethiopia

britain and france are still hungry.

they never got thailand

the united states ran out of destiny to manifest, so they're looking for more.

hawaii

cuba

wait, spain controls cuba.

well, blame something on them and go to war!

what should we blame on spain?

let's blame the maine on spain.

so they blame the maine on spain.

now we're in business.

to celebrate, they kick panama out of panama and make a canal, connecting the two oceans.

britain just found oil in the middle east.

it makes cars go

china is so tired of being bossed around that they delete their old government and make a new, stronger government, which is accidentally weaker and controlled by a guy from the previous government.

europe hasn't had a war since the last war.

so they start world war 1.

look at those guns.

it's gonna be a great war.

so great we won't need a second one.

after it's over, they blame germany.

russia went on strike and the workers overthrew the government.

now everyone's paycheck is the same.

communism

in the soviet union

the arabs revolt and britain helps.

now the ottoman empire's gone so we can give the

jewish people a place to live

hopefully the arabs won't mind.

let's cut the cake, said sykes and picot, carving up the remains of the not-so-ottoman-anymore empire.

except turkey, turkey makes a brand new turkey

and then the saudis conquer arabia.

it just seemed like the right thing to do.

hello?

yes, it's the 1920's calling.

let's get in the car and drive to a party and listen to jazz on the radio and go to the movies.

the economy's great and it'll probably be great forever, just kidding.

germany's back, featuring hitler, the angry mustache model.

and he's mad at the jews for existing.

japan is finally conquering the east, and they're so excited they rape nanking way too hard.

they should probably just deny it.

hitler's out of control.

so the international community tackles him and then tries to explain why killing all the jews is a bad idea.

but he kills himself before they could explain it to him.

that's world war 2

bonus round!

pacific showdown.

united states vs. japan.

fight!

finish him

let's unite all the nations and have some

world peace

seems legit.

hi, i'm gandhi, and if britain doesn't get the hell out of india, i'm gonna starve myself in public.

wow, that worked?

bonus, now there's pakistan.

actually two pakistans.

one of them can be bangladesh later.

the jews and the arabs finally figured out which one of them should live in the holy land.

me, they both said at the same time.

let's divide up the land so everyone's happy.

sike, they both get angrier

look out china, there's a new china in china.

what's on the menu?

communism!

no thanks, said the other china, escaping to an island.

i wonder which one is the real china?

there's the korean war, korea versus korea.

nobody wins, then it's on pause forever.

let's meet the sponsors.

oh, it's the two global superpowers.

they're having a friendly debate over which economic system is good, and which one is an evil virus of Satan.

and they both have atom bombs.

fight!

wait, no, that would be the end of the world.

let's just keep it cool and spy on each other instead.

and make sure we have enough atom bombs.

i'll race you to space.

now let's make some more countries fight themselves.

europe is tired of pillaging other continents, so the continents they were pillaging are tired of being pillaged.

so here's a new map, with new countries.

now you can't tell who they're being pillaged by.

the united states finally decided whether racism is good or bad.

they decided it's bad, and the world agrees.

south africa might need another minute to think about it.

let's check the world population.

whoa.

okay.

technology's better too, that might keep happening.

the soviet union decides to relax a little, and accidentally falls apart.

europe makes a union, so now they can all use the same money, except britain, because they don't feel like it.

let's check the mail.

surprise, it's on the computer.

whoops, someone just attacked america.

i bet they'll remember that.

phone call.

surprise, it's in your pocket.

wanna learn everything?

surprise, it's on the computer.

now your phone's a computer, which is in your pocket.

whoops, the economy just crashed.

don't worry, the big banks won't fail because they're not supposed to.

surprise!

flying robots.

with bombs.

wanna print a brain?

some people have no friends.

some people have no food.

the globe is warming

and the ocean is full of plastic

let's save the planet! said everybody, not knowing how.

let's invent a thing inventor, said the thing inventor inventor, after being invented by a thing inventor.

that's pretty cool.

by the way, where the hell are we?

I'm having a little trouble what you're saying here. But having a baby is a commitment people make. They need to be ready to care for it if they decide to have one. They should wise and have good judgement. When having a baby, you should not be able to take back your decision. Once the baby becomes a single cell, the commitment starts. Taking back your commitment means to take a life. Taking a life is m.urder.

And before you tell me, 'oh what if they were r.aped?' most cases of abortions happen because of embarrassment over foolish decisions.

Abortion should not be tolerated, because I believe it takes away the life of another human being, who is the same as each and every one of us.",2,1,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/political-coding-club-v1/35041/151,2017-07-30 05:16:41 UTC

Hopscotch Programming Puzzles,Math,-,No,"Ooh! Primality tests! I have discovered a primaliy test myself (although quite by accident) with the use of polygons. 

First, create any n-gon you'd like. Start at a point, and draw a line from that point to the next point closest to it. Then, do that again in the same direction, but instead of going to the next point, go to the next one, 2 points over. Then 3, then 4, and 5. This eventually creates a pattern.

(Sorry if this seemed confusing, I'll add a picture below and a better explanation)

           • (a)

     • (e)       • (b)


      • (d)     • (c)

So you draw a line from A to B, B to D, D to B, B to A, A to A, and it repeats itself

So as I draw lines from point to point, it increases by increments of 1. For any n-gon where ""n"" is divisible by 2, the line pattern we've made is rotationally symmetrical (180 to 180). 

For any n-gon where ""n"" is prime, the line pattern we made is not symmetrical whatsoever (Now you might be saying, ""Ah, but what happens when you have an n-gin where 'n' is odd? I have a proof for this, too)

For any n-gon where ""n"" is odd, the line pattern we made is not symmetrical, but some points that the line travels through get reused, whereas prime n-gons do not. Here's a picture to help understanding:

I think this has to do with mods, but I haven't learned them yet. So I have no idea. But I think this is extremely cool, but probably not the best for finding vastly huge prime numbers.

Hopscotch Programming Puzzles,Math,-,No,"Wow, thank you!

I have realized through the years that learning math at school is absolutely terrible.

[details=A whole rant about why school and math don't go together]
Most schools teach math in a very uninspiring way, a way that'll make people feel like math is boring and a waste of time. However, there are some people, like me, who just love math. I don't know why I started to love math, but I remember in Kindergarten being fascinated with areas of mathematics like multiplication and quadrillions and large numbers (Googology is a lot of fun, I used to to extremely interested in large numbers, and still am, and there's a whole wiki about it! 😄). I had heard of these things outside of school, outside of what they were teaching us. This kind of creates a curiousness and the natural love of math because you begin to descover, ""Woah. There's a ***LOT*** more out there than what is being taught at school."" School kind of shows the tip of the ice burg of mathematics, but they do it in such an uninspiring way that most kids never want to find out the hidden mysteries underneath. That is why it is crucial that if you want to learn math, be good at it, and have fun with it, you must do it in you're own time
[/details]

I have been some Khan Academy, I realized that I could do trig over the summer, but a lot of it was review in a way, and I also really despise the videos. They are really boring. I did find a section of math in Khan, but at the very end of the math journey. It's called, ""Math for fun and glory"". They only show videos and it's a lot of fun, I definitely would recommend it (I must admit I would've been even more excited about it a year or 2 ago since I've learned the math topics by watching things like Numberphile) (Also, they bring on a different person, I forget her name, but she does *actual* drawing with a marker on lined paper. It is absolutely glorious).

[quote=""BuildASnowman, post:41, topic:36686""]
just you, the internet, and whatever you want to learn about.
[/quote]

Yeah, I had realized that very quickly when I decided that math had become my life. However, without a core study place, you have no 100% proof that your actually going to find a place where you can learn math that is fun and easy (Especially for topics like calculus and abstract algebra and higher dimensional math -- which is an absolute bummer because these subjects are so fascinating).

Throughout that past year, I have been watching Numberphile very thouroughly. I also found a new YouTube channel called 3Blue1Brown that teaches many things like calculus. I had also been able to collect some books to make a mathematical bookshelf, which I am very excited about. (Some of my favorites were, Hyperspace (when looking online for it, type: Hyperspace (book) ), What to make and do in the 4th dimension, and Ian Stewart's mathematical cabinet (And also ""What if?"" by xkcd).

I have also realized that math and science literally go hand in hand, which is a whole new thing

Woah, I've typed a lot, I get really excited about math when I'm able to talk about it with people who have the same kind of passion for it, thank you so much!

Also, I created a topic here on the forum a few weeks ago that show math recourses people can use, I'm probably going to fix it up and add some more. I think it is a great idea so that people who are bored in school can find amazing ways to learn (The girl who talks in the ""Math for fun and glory"" even admits that school math is boring, she just doodles all class about more interesting parts of math (hehe, I did that in my Algebra 2 class, but I probably should have.)

i wouldn’t take the courses without a good understanding of the basics of calc
[/quote]

Ok, awesome, I should probably read a book or 2 on it (or probably the actual AoPS book). I just completed Algebra 2 and I learned nearly all of Trig on Khan Academy, but I have not whatsoever touched Pre Calc yet. I was shown the completion quiz of trig/precalc, which was neat, but I am not too sure if I'd be able to understand the calc class yet. (I hear calculus is just an advanced version of Algebra + Geometry + Alg.2 + Trig + PreCalc shoved into one awesome course. So learning and mastering the basics of all these subjects are most likely crucial) (I also found a YouTube series on Calculus made by 3Blue1Brown that I'm going to be watching really soon, that's probably going to be a big help)

So my main question is whether or not the AoPS group chat lessons are any good or not. I see that you need to have a huge understanding in the subject (this reminds me of Stories my friends told me about the AMC how the questions get progressively harder really fast). So I'm kind of scared and nervous, but also really excited about it!

Here's is an example:

1: (4 + 4)/(4 + 4)

The 4's that you can use are 4, .4, and .4 repeating.

Why do we need moderators to create groups and tag lists?,Meta - Forum,-,No,"Haha! I've reached this topic

Ok, HealeyBot, you do make a fair point, it would be nice and efficient let anyone create group tags. You can email the creator of Discourse about that because I think it's a pretty neat idea.

However, if people begin creating random tags left and right, it sort of becomes disorganized. It's nice to have a limited amount of tags (So maybe 2 or 3 per account for gt's + other things). And then if we would like to create more tags, we can ask a moderator to do so

(And btw, is t1 the only moderator so far? Last I've seen her post was Sept. 11 or something like that. Must be end of school vacation in Australia (it'd be winter instead of summer) and she'd like to take a break before college)

Hello again! My brother is still working on this truly epic Mario game. He is 100% finished with the main game (and tutorial) and is working on the Boss Fight and the end game. I'd say we will be finished by 1/14 and will start touching it up. We are trying to get the game out on the 19th, because we will be leaving for a camp on that day. 

A few new Mario Minigames are also in the works, and will be coming out shortly, hopefully one of them before the truly epic Mario game

Last note: I've played through the entire game already (except the boss fight and end game) and I am really excited with what my younger brother has been able to do! It will *definetely* be put on Game Changers! See y'all around 👌

Hey all, my brother and I are working on one truly epic Mario game!
It's got levels and Star Coins and a lot of cool things.
However, the game is too big to edit anymore, so THT is currently editing the JSON to let it run faster.
At most, this game will be completed in around 2-3 weeks.

Typing about equal to in Hopscotch might be harder than actually typing a >, < bound:

If (x > 10) & (x < 13)

Plus, you never use about equal to in mathematical expressions (Well, I mean you do use it, but it's just a rounding tool that you use in the answer of a problem. Like: 5.000123 ~ 5 or whatever. Easy to implement in Hopscotch. They don't need to ceate an entirely new block.)

[details=Mathematical Operators (3)]
>**Plus or Minus Operator**

How it'll help: Then we don't need to say 2^(1/3) to mean the 3rd root of 2. It's easier to understand.

>**The Complete Set of Boolean Operators** (Logic Gates)

>**Adjusting the Volume of Sounds**
How it'll help: Now you can create music with Forticimo and other music stuff. You can make things quite or loud without the user manually changing the volume with the device

How it helps: Now you can choose the transparency of a trial, and instead of a trail completely overlapping another trail, it just blends to make a new color.

[details=Variables (3)]
>**Global Variable Assigning**
How it helps: Assign all variables a specific number

>**Using ""&"" when assigning Variables**
How it helps: Set chosen variables to a specific number using one block. Ex) [Set (Var1) & (Var2) to 7]

>**Input Variable**
How it helps: Keeps track of a user's input. You can find the nth (input) fibinacci number just by typing a number! The number is then run through the code and then outputted. Neat!
>>• When (input) = 7
• Repeat (input) times
• Now quizzes don't have to be multiple choice?
• If (input) = ""random text""
• etc.

[/details]

[details=Control Flow (1)]
>**Delete Clone Block**
How it helps: Now you can delete clones so that it frees up space! Ex) [Delete up to (15) Clones]

> ---
>We know how the Pythagorean Theorem works, right?
>a^2 + b^2 = c^2
>There are infinitely many solutions to this!
>
> ---
>Can you find more Pythagorean triples in other powers larger than 2?
> Ex)   Solve for a, b, and c
>a^3 + b^3 = c^3
>a, b, and c must be larger than 1

>What about for 4th powers, or 5th powers?.. etc.


<sub> Question 2
[quote=""MR.GAM3R, post:100, topic:34438""]
**The Poisoned Drink Riddle**

The King of a small country invites 1000 senators to his annual party. As a tradition, each senator brings the King a bottle of drink. 

Soon after, the Queen discovers that one of the senators is trying to assassinate the King by giving him a bottle of poisoned drink. 

Unfortunately, they do not know which senator, nor which bottle of drink is poisoned, and the poison is completely indiscernible. 

However, the King has 10 prisoners he plans to execute.

 He decides to use them as taste testers to determine which bottle of drink contains the poison. 

The poison when taken has no effect on the prisoner until exactly 24 hours later when the infected prisoner suddenly dies. 

The King needs to determine which bottle of drink is poisoned by tomorrow so that the festivities can continue as planned. 

Hence he only has time for one round of testing.

I have chosen to keep this user's name anonymous for now. Please do not post their name below. If the Hopscotch Team would like to know the user's name, please ask us. The user may or may not want to reveal themself on this topic, and may choose whether or not they would like to be revealed.

Reasons for wanting this removal:
• Consistent Bullyin<hi>g
• Previous ban (Ban has only recently been lifted)
• Ignoring warnings from Leaders
• Loging into a separate account to avoid a ban and/or removal (**7 Times**) (I'm losing track of the counts)
• Frequently being off topic
• Attacking Hopscotchers and swearing at them
• Cyber threats towards Hopscotchers
• Vandalization of topics
• Calling Hopscotchers ""autistic"" as a derogatory term
• Frequently targeting certain mental disorders
**• Posting multiple links and referring to **very** innaproprate sites**
• Revealing personal information
• Impersonating HS Forum accounts and framing them
• Avoiding account removal by creating a new account
• This list can only go on

Here, I ask all Hopscotchers on the Forum to vote below that this user should be banned. Thank you very much for reading, this is an extremely serious topic:

[poll]

- Yes, this user should be banned
- I would like to comment below on my point of view about this

[/poll]

Current Bullyinġ on the Forum,Meta - Forum,-,No,"Haha, thanks.
Yes, t1 had even talked to them about this and had been suspended. Once the suspension was relieved, though, they went straight back to breaking the Community guidelines.

I know it seems harsh to completely remove them (actually, I don't know if it is possible or not), but I would rather keep the forum safe for children",7,1,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/current-bullying-on-the-forum/39623/4,2017-12-31 00:41:22 UTC

[quote=""MyPi, post:1, topic:39692""]
And to tell you the truth, people who are being mean to him/her deserve to be suspended more than s/he does.
[/quote]


I don't agree with this, though. Just because people are frustrated at a user who says they are only here to troll and get some laughs, doesn't mean they deserve to be suspended. Everyone makes mistakes and deserves a second chance.

Now, if they are breaking the community guidlines in their frustration, then they need to receive a warning. After the warning has been received, and then ignored, then can the leaders contemplate suspension.

But the fact that Xse/hnu overrid the moderators decision of suspension by creating new accounts and committing many more despicable acts, means that he deserves a removal from the forum. Not because what kind of person he is, but because we want to keep the forum safe for kids.

The reason  I created the topic with the list and the vote, was because I wanted to get THT's attention. I wanted them to know how much of a big deal this was, and how many people were being effected by it.

[details=The FAQ]

What is the Shiggity-Diggity-Shak?
The Shiggity-Diggity-Shak is a lovely place to hand around and have a jig of a time. Remember to be cool as a bean and.<hi>. Don't forget to buy yams at the marker if you like 'me.

Where is the Yam Market?
The Yam Market is a market that specifically only sells yams, and byproducts of yams. Yam Market's can be located in friendly neighborhood towns, to big cities, to mini gas station shoppies, or sometimes in the good 'ol country. You can never run across too many of these markets.

How many spoons can you balance on your nose?
Well, I can balance 1 spoon for a good half a second, but if I really want to have some supreme spoon balancing, I need to get one of those big spoon ladles, like for serving soup. Or pasta. Something big like that is easier to balance on your naval.

If spaghetts is sooo good, why don't they make Spaghett's Markets?
Well, in the past couple of months, yams and byproducts of yams have been all the rage. Especially in places like Greenland, Iceland, Finland, Scotland, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. However, places like the U S of A are beginning to fall into the peer pressure of a Yam only diet. These rest are called YOD's because they are Yam only. If you or a loved one are feeling like they should be on a YOD, drive to the nearest Yam Market!

Someone is living in the roof of my house. How do I deal with this?
Well, sometimes you can get a nice big broom, or a pole, and start knocking real hard on the ceiling. This usually gets the attention of roof squatters. Every once in a while, these roof squatters are asleep, so now it is your responsibility to climb your roof and make loud obnoxious noises. If the roof squatters still don't leave, use them as a source of electricity and plug all your electronics into their laptop and drain their power!

Why can't I ever see elephants hiding in the trees?
Because they're real good at hiding.

How come my step Aunt Susie is invading our lawn?
If crazed aunts come over trampling your lawn, beware! They may be under an intoxicating virus known as, SuperStepAuntoPhobiaGrass. Whoever named that was a real genius. However, please take these precautions if you think your crazed Aunt is invading lawns. ( 1. Stop Drop and roll. This will draw attention hopefully away from you. 2. Create a fort made of pillows, couches, couch cushions, and chairs in your house. Your Aunt may be planning to attack. 3. Connect your fort to the fridge because you don't know how long you'll be in there. 4. If you happen to peer out the window and see that there is no grass on the lawn, take caution. Soon, you'll hear something in the fireplace. Step away from the fireplace and run across the hall. Never turn your back on the fireplace, because your Aunt may secretly cross attack you with mystery cameras. 5. Once the fire is in the fireplace is unlit, brace for impact, as a lot of grass will suddenly shoot out!)

Will I get rewarded in Shmeckles for reading this far into the FAQ?
You betcha dogs you will! Here's 5 Shmeckles right now! I'm feeling real generous today.

What is the temperature of my shoes?
Well, it all depends on how sticky your feet are, if you have been walking within the past 30 seconds, depending on your age, and depending on if you are also wearing socks inside, or outside of the shoes. If you are very curious on the temperature of your shoes, use a household thermometer. If the shoe's temperature exceeds that of the room temperature of your house, these shoes are too warm. Place cold ice cubes into these shoes and wait until they melt. Dry out your shoes carefully and place them back onto your feet if you feel it is safe. Beware, a common side effect can be cold feet, so make sure you made your decision before hand and ask a friend to help you with your situation.

What is one thing that if I cut a hole in it, it'll have less holes?
A net, of course.

These are socks that you individually slip onto each finger. They are like finger puppets, but have the same wooly texture as a sock. They are collectible too, and would definitely knock the Market's socks off.

[details=The Very Important Rules]

Well, if you do want some boring rules, here you go fellow:
By entering JonnyGamer's General Topic, you have intentionally and/or unintentionally promised that you will follow the community guidelines of the Hopscotch Forum, and the rules and regulatories that fall into place.
You have agreed to: 
* Always have a good time, but not at the expense of others (In this case, never bully other forumers on JonnyGamer's General Topic. Doing so may result in multiple flags, angry forumers, and in extreme cases, suspension, expulsion, repulsion, minor injuries, fatal injuries, removal of forum account(s), and/or a passive aggressive email to your parents or guardians or uncles or aunts or relations.)
* Never reveal personal information about yourself or others (Do not reveal in any way: your ema<hi>is addres<hi>s(es), phon<hi>e numb<hi>er(s), soc<hi>ial securit<hi> numbe<hi>r(s) (How can you even get multiple of those?), passpor<hi>t(s), Posta<hi>l Cod<hi>e, Hous<hi>e Addres<hi>s(es), I<hi>P Adres<hi>s(es), medical prescription information, political perspective(s) (I don't want it to be a political place, guys), fax(es), social media account(s) (including: Instagram, Snap Chat, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube (actually, I think that ones fine), MySpace, LinkedIN, Google+, Pinterest, Tumblr, Flickr, Reddit, WhatsApp, Quora, Vine, Vine 2, Periscope, BizSugar, StumbleUpon, Sarahah, Delicious, Digg, Viber, QQ, Wechat, Geometry Dash Account, Geometry Dash Lite Account, Angry Birds Account, Flappy Bird Account, Apple ID Account, Microsoft Account, Microsoft Live Account, Adobe Photoshop Account, etc.), I think you get the picture. I want this reeeeal *anonymous* hehe, let's see if he notices.)
* Be as chill as a bean (Well, have you ever seen a bean be chill? These chill beans are so chill, they sit there and chill out for a few days. Ipand im not talking about any regular old days. I'm talking about Sundays and Monday Mornings, and even Leap Years and maybe even Ground Hogs Day I can't remember. Anyway, what do these chill beans do as they chill out on Monday Mornings. You see, one of these chill beans is named Fredrick Von Shpotz and he happens to be a good friend of award winning Fredrick Von Shpotz II (the Second) and they are as chill as a bean on top of banana pudding. And if you've ever tried that, you are in for a surprise. It's as chill as you can get, and really is self explanatory once you have seen for yourself. So do me a favor (favour if you live in Great Britain. Cheerio) and check it out for yourself. It is a real crowd pleaser.)

Ok, so I don't know if you all caught this, but an hour ago, a Forum user was impersonated. (8PM - 12PM Pacific Time)

Healeybot1 was framed by no other than you know who we've been talking about lately. It all came up in the Vandalized Numberphile Topic at post 88.

The following folders cointain hard evidence on how it happened, and steps you can take to protect yourself from a cyber attack.

[details=How to know for sure Healeybot1 actually was impersonated]

@Healeybot1
This is the real tag

@HeaIeybot1
This is the fake tag, used as a cyber attack

Even though the profile pictures are the same, the names are actually not the same. If you look real closely at the ""L"" in Healeybot1, you can see that the fake tag's ""L"" looks a little bit off. This is because it is actually an uppercase ""i"". Don't believe me? Try it for yourself and tag them (For all of you who were worried that they both had the same name and the bully had found an exploit)

The fake tag was also made 1 day ago, which also proves it wasn't the real one.

Ok, so this is a big issue. How do I prevent myself from getting impersonated and framed?

[/details]

---

[details=How to protect yourself]

• Create a custom gif profile pic
Pros: Now, an impersonater cannot save the image, because it's not an image. It's a gif
Cons: A little difficult to create. You need certain apps for this

• Have your nickname be safe. Don't use these letters:
Oo0 (Oh's and Zero's)
l I (Lowercase L's and Uppercase i's)
Pros: Harder to impersonate!
Cons: You get 5 less characters

• Create alternate accounts for yourself with all possible configurations of your name that could easily be misread as your username. Example: J0nnyGamer, JOnnyGamer, Jonnygamer, JomyGanner, and especially JonnyGamėr (That little dot on top of the ""e"" is really tricky to spot).
Pros: Now impersonators can't *ever* impersonate you!
Cons: This takes a *really* long time, and you'll need to create a bunch of new emails for yourself. But it's worth it. <sub> probably </sub>
Somewhere in Between: THT will be real happy to see a whole bunch of new users! <sub> Oh, wait.<hi>.

• Make a good impression on the forum, so when stuff like this happens, you can immediately say, ""Oh yeah, that is definitely not them. But be impersonated again, oh well."" (Just like in the Healeybot1 case, we could tell right away something fishy was up)
Pros: Hey, nothing like being a trustworthy person with respect and frendos!
Cons: I can't think of any, unless you want to be deliberately rude, in which case, this forum is not the best fit for you

[/details]

---

This is a serious issue and is *currently* happening right now!
But, I now know that Healeybot1 is as cool as a potato 👌
Keep a look out for *any* suspicious activity on the forums. Flag and Report all suspicions.
Lastly, I'd like to apologize to @Healeybot1 (real one) for sticking it through. He's had the rough end of the bully situation (and now he's getting tagged a whole lot). I want to say I'm real proud of you for keeping your cool and being awesome 👍 

Thank you all so much for reading this!
And please vote!

[poll public = true]
- This totally helped! Thanks so much! I'll keep a look out for further suspicious activity

If he’s all powerful why can’t he give the poor people food? The homeless people a home? There’s a lot of suffering in our world but god seemingly does nothing to stop it
[/quote]

Ooh! Here's the big whammmey!
This is one of the questions that are real hard to answer.

Yes, there is suffering in this world. A whole bunch of it, quite a lot of it.
However, we brought this suffering upon ourselves (If you believe in the Bible). Basically, we live in a fallen world with a bunch of evil stuff in it.

However, God does give us a chance to choose him and live in a perfecto place. He sent his Son to die for us (because He loves us jut that mucho) so that we could have eternal life. But how do we receive this epic gift? By believing in him. That's it, easy peasy lemon squeezy.

But wait wait wait, but to your oriiiginal question:
Why can't He give the poor people food and the homeless homes?

Well,<hi>, here we go: He calls us to give the poor food and the homeless homes. And in doing so, we have shown them the same love that God shows us. And now they can do the same to others and so on. In other words, the world becomes a happier place.

However, everyone makes mistakes, and we don't always do the right thing. But that's a-ok if we understand what we did wrong and try to change it as best we canners

<sub> <sub> Well, maybe by the time you are reading this, it might not be that old

The Numberphile Topic is where we talk about:
Math
Numberphile
More Math
The Reimann Hypothesis
Euler
And everything about math
<sub> and higher dimensions
<sub> <sub> and the twin prime conjecture
<sub> <sub> <sub> I love math
---
If you haven't already, watch the Numberfile YouTube videos. They are epic.

Also, this is where we share ideas, invent coding tips and tricks, and create math questions
We will also try to solve the Reimann Hypothesis ($1 million prize!)

[details=Math Problems!]

<sub>Question 1

>**Fermat's Last Theorem**
>
> ---
>We know how the Pythagorean Theorem works, right?
>a^2 + b^2 = c^2
>There are infinitely many solutions to this!
>
> ---
>Can you find more Pythagorean triples in other powers larger than 2?
> Ex)   Solve for a, b, and c
>a^3 + b^3 = c^3
>a, b, and c must be larger than 1
>
> ---
>####Is this possible??
>What about for 4th powers, or 5th powers?.. etc.


<sub> Question 2
[quote=""MR.GAM3R, post:100, topic:34438""]
**The Poisoned Drink Riddle**

The King of a small country invites 1000 senators to his annual party. As a tradition, each senator brings the King a bottle of drink. 

Soon after, the Queen discovers that one of the senators is trying to assassinate the King by giving him a bottle of poisoned drink. 

Unfortunately, they do not know which senator, nor which bottle of drink is poisoned, and the poison is completely indiscernible. 

However, the King has 10 prisoners he plans to execute.

 He decides to use them as taste testers to determine which bottle of drink contains the poison. 

The poison when taken has no effect on the prisoner until exactly 24 hours later when the infected prisoner suddenly dies. 

The King needs to determine which bottle of drink is poisoned by tomorrow so that the festivities can continue as planned. 

Hence he only has time for one round of testing.

[details=Math Puzzles/Games!]
<sub> Game 1
> This Puzzle is called: **The Four 4's**
In this puzzles you try to create numbers using four 4's, and mathematical expressions.
For Example:
1 = (4 + 4)/(4 + 4)
>
>How many numbers can you get?
Allowed mathematical symbols:
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponentiation, Square Roots/Radicals, Adding Numbers in the Index of Radicals, Factorials, Inversing (Power of -1)
>
>Math Symbols to use if you need some help:
Percents, Concatenation, Primorials, Square root directly on a square root (I don't want multiple of these, since it'd be like a fourth root.)
>
>How far can you go? My record is something like 150. I'll double check and also post the solutions.

Bug with bumping several clones at once,Bugs with Hopscotch,-,No,"Huh! This is a real sticker. I did some playing around and found some data

Once any object's (no matter the size, I tried this with different objects) center reaches within 150 pixels (on Retina display, 300) of the Fan's center, the collision occurs.

I also set the fans clone value to stop cloning once there are 11 clones (11 is the minimum value for this glitch to happen)

When the center's were 150 pixels away, the collision did not occur, however, when brought just a pixel closer, the collision occurred.

[details=Welcome Note]
Welcome to the Unnoficial Guide on How to Forum, made by yooours truly, and a lot of help from others.

I'd like to thank all you people who are taking the time to read this. I tried to make this as interesting as possible, so here y'all go
[/details]

---

[details=Why the Forum?]
Well, I see you are reading this post, so.<hi>. Let's talk about the Forum!

**Why was this Forum created?**
The main reason that the big guys at Hopscotch bought the Forum was so that Hopscotchers, like you and me, could easily learn, share, and communicate with each other.

(Pretty much as a fix to the chat rooms that were muddying up the Newest section, if you know what I mean. I think it still happens, though 😐)

**Why are you here?**
Well, there may be a number of reasons why you are on the forum. The most popular reasons are:
- To easily learn, share, and communicate with other Hopscotchers
- To hang around with friends in a stress free environment

**Wait? I thought it was code only, though?**
Hey, that's a great question! Back in the olden days before the categories were introduced, saying something un-codey related was a big no-no.

 **Woah, man, must've been real strict**
Exactly, we all soon realized that it is also fine and dandy to communicate with other Hopscotchers and have fun. We all have busy loves and we just need some recoop time, right?

**But we can't go about willy nilly, right? That'd just defeat the purpose!**
Right again, you can't just go around speaking your mind in topics where people are in a deep convo about math. That'd just be disruptive, annoying, wouldn't benefit the conversation in any way, your reputation would drop probably (unless you're too cool for school (Anonymous) ) and would probably result in a flag for being off topic.

**Alrighty, so were can we relax, so to speak?**

I really appreciate that you did this, it must of taken an hour or so to get all this down, and I see that you really care about the state of the forum. You'll go far, my friend 😄

I would like to give some advice here, if you'll allow me. I've seen that a few of your ideas in here are a little bit oppinionative, for example the how to deal with your anger section. If your frustrated with someone/thing or have just been having a bad day, the forum really isn't the best place for that, since it's a programming forum. 

If you are seriously frustrated with someone on the forum, I'd choose to take some deep breaths and relax a bit. Once you've got your common senses, try to put yourself in their shoes and think about them instead of yourself, and how this situation may be effecting them. I'd say the best bet is to calmly work it out with the user, or just take some time off of the forum. The forum shouldn't cause stress, it should be a stress free environment where we are all excited to learn, share, and have a good time. 👌 Peace out",7,1,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/the-guide-to-not-getting-flagged-on-the-forum/39862/13,2018-01-09 05:46:42 UTC

FriendIy debating -The Informers :loudspeaker: (Topic 2),Lounge,-,No,"Aaaah, since we are on the Big Bang theory

This theory is just lovely, we've got zeeeero evidence, and I honestly think it's gonna be debunked and passed up by a new scientific theory *real* soon (hyperdimensional multiverse Quantum string theory to be exact. Hoowie! It'll be an interesting time! 😄)

I'm like a total science/math buff. I take the stuff super seriously. I'd also like to talk about the universal background microwave radiation. It *should* be super symmetrical if the Big Bang really did happen. But, it's not, so we just put a rut in our own theory. Aw snapples D<sorry>:

Oi, so what now?
Time to hyperact into Hyperion, oh waaaait hold up.<hi>. Pretty close to 99% of all scientists/government officials are pretty darn happy with the theory they've produced. They're not gonna change anytime soon. (And now it's about politics. I reeeeally don't like politics and sciences mixing up. It's like curling milk. Real nasty)

And before you tell be the universe is expanding, listen to this. The universe is expanding at an *in*constant rate. It's totally speeding up. That means the uranium is radiating at faster and faster rates because of the dark energy that is making the universe more and more into an elliptoid (there's about in average 4 hydrogen atoms in any given cubic meter in the universe, which is why it's slightly an elliptoid.) it totally effects the radiation and the expansion rate of the universe. This paragraph probably doesn't make any sense, it doesn't for me

You know what, scratch that previous paragraph. So, the universe is expanding, right? That'd be some evidence that maybe we all started at a small point and then blamo'd to what we have now. Ooook, but we haven't fully understood dark energy, and why it's pushing us away from different galaxy clusters. Maybe it's a sine graph that pushes us out, then pulls us back in, but not terribly close. We really have no idea whatsoever with our pinpoint of 30 years of electronics. We shouldn't have a conclusion so soon, let's wait another 13.7 billion years and find out. That's nothing on the cosmic scale. Idk broooos

All I know is that I cannot wait for a few million years until the Andromeda galaxy will collide with the Milky Way. Sounds horrifying, but it's totally safe since stars are soooo far apart. And it'll be truly epic to watch. But I probs won't live for a few hundred million years. Unless reincarnation is a thing. In which I'm down for it. 😂

You know what, that was a total ramble and I probably shouldn't post it cause I'm tired and I probably made some mistakes, but, brownie points for you if you literally read it all.

Hello again! My brother is still working on this truly epic Mario game. He is 100% finished with the main game (and tutorial) and is working on the Boss Fight and the end game. I'd say we will be finished by 1/14 and will start touching it up. We are trying to get the game out on the 19th, because we will be leaving for a camp on that day. 

A few new Mario Minigames are also in the works, and will be coming out shortly, hopefully one of them before the truly epic Mario game

Last note: I've played through the entire game already (except the boss fight and end game) and I am really excited with what my younger brother has been able to do! It will *definetely* be put on Game Changers! See y'all around 👌

1. We will be creating a truly epic story, except on the forum.

2. What I'm going to do is write the very first sentence, and then tag someone.

3. The person tagged will write the next sentence to this story and can choose to tag someone else. (If the person tagged doesn't receive it within 5 minutes, it is up for grabs 👍)

4. If a post isn't tagged, anyone can create the next sentence! Just tell us so we don't get five people writing all at once.

5. When you write your sentence, post it, and then add it into the Global Edit post below, so we can have the whole thing.

6. Have fun! Don't write anything innapropriate, but you can keep it as interesting as you'd like 😂

1<hi>. Once upon a time, there was an egg named Eggbert Julius the Third
2. Julius cracked open and a dodo bird came out
3. Then the dodo bird died a terrible deat<hi>h when he was eaten by a pig name Oink
4. Oink was captured in a pokéball
5. Suddenly a magic penguin appeared
6. And then Julius Egbert willed himself back to life, but to seek revenge upon the penguins!
7. And then the penguins viciously fried Eggbert
8. And then the dodo came back to life and attacked the mess of 2018
9. And then the dodo flew up into the sky, glowing, because none of us deserve it’s beauty
10. then the Dodo bird found an abandoned baby penguin all alone in the sky
11. But as the dodo flew up in the sky, the penguins started plotting to take over the world with their magic
12. Dodo was so tired of all her flying that she didn’t have strength to attack the penguin.
13. As Dodo began to slowly fall down to the earth, the thoughts began to race through their mind.
14. He burned up going through the atmosphere and died.
15. Dodo thought about how meaningless their life was as Eggbert Julius the Third and decided that they wouldn’t waste their new life as a Dodo and regained their energy just before hitting the floor.
16. Dodo squealed and burst into flames before falling into a lake.
17. As the penguin army approached Dodo, Dodo secretly stole their Life Chrystals and hid in his secret safe zone.
18. The penguins, not knowing about the secret safe zone all died and the Dodo ate all the Crystals to extend its life.
19. But the crystal did more then just extend its life, it also...
20. Gave Dodo the ability to fly.
21. And it also gave Dodo invisibility.
22. But it also transformed Dodo into a muffin.
23. Dodo was perfectly content being a muffin in his safe zone, so he decided to throw a super smashing' partay
24. But how was he supposed to send invitations without his feathers?
25. His muffin powers let him write and he wrote invitations for is friends: the other dodo and mister puffin and the tall giraffe.
26. Then he posted them and waited for them to arrive.
27. But he fell asleep.
28. When the party members cam they didn’t see dodo, all they saw was an appetizing muffin and they thought it was party food so they ate it.
29. Dodo died in the mouth of his friends.
30. The former 'Dodo' was now a teabag that was in an icy incasement
31. He was now staring out in Penguin Headquarters.
32. He dyed his exterior and screamed, ""I AM ALIIIVE!!!""
33. Dodo's a teabag now; Dodo was a muffin; His name is now teabag and he has no feathers to dye pink.
34. Also, Teabag was completely incased in deep ice, so when he screamed, it was as if he were talking to himself.
35. The magical penguins didn't hear the teabag (Dodo) yell, as they were conducting an experiment to retrieve their lost Life Chrystals (that Dodo stole)
36. Teabag became enraged and turned the ice into boiling water which he turned into tea.
37. When the penguins saw that the water had become tea, they feared that Tea would melt the water under their feet.
38. The penguins grabbed buckets of sugar and other stuff and through them into the tea.
39. SweeTeaStuffz amped up the temperature and melted everything, the ice included, and the penguins fell and burned to deat<h>h.
40. Out of the water, a figure appeared, SweeTeaStuffz in human form.
41. When everything had melted, Teabag fell into the abyss with the penguins and died",10,7,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/the-super-forum-story/39880/2,2018-01-10 00:43:39 UTC

Hey, Hopscotchers! I've been doodling around the Forum, and I've heard from quite a few people that we should bring back Community Leaders! I'm here to discus in this topic the pros and cons on Community Leaders.

---

[details=What is a Leader?]

A Leader is a step above a Regular. Leaders can do all sorts of things, and they have a huge responsibility. As of now, you cannot will yourself to become a leader, but the administration must choose you to become a leader.

[How to become a Leader & What do they do?](https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-user-trust-levels-do/4924/7)

[/details]

---

[details=Why do we need new Community Leaders?]

We need someone who regularly checks the Forum, and is able to keep it tidy and safe for kids. Recently, there have been some issues that have compromised the kid-friendliness of the Forum, and there wasn't a Leader to stomp it out (Well, there was, but that Leader has left the Forum, and the issue has returned). This is the main reason why we need Community Leaders.

We would also like Leaders to host some competitions! We like fun and games on the Forum :<hi>D (Leaders are able to hand out some really cool prizes, like a personalized nickname)

Lastly, Leaders are awesome for creating group tag list. It was really helpful when t1 was willing to do that for us as well as be an active Leader on the Forum!

[/details]

---

[details=But how are we going to choose?]

There are 2 ways that would be good to choose Leaders:

• Have a vote by the community
Pros: We can easily decide who would make a great Leader!
Cons: Most people would vote for popular people, and popular may not be the best answer.

• Have the Hopscotch Team look around and see for themselves who would be mature enough to make a great Leader
Pros: THT could use some good judgement and pick an awesome Leader
Cons: It might take a while

I propose an idea! If we do happen to create a voting topic, here is how the voting/nominating should take place.

There will be a post *directly below* the official post that will be put on Global Edit. Each Hopscotcher will nominate 5 (and up) users, and give explanations to why these users would make great Leaders. This would include acts of kindness, being able to calm down a flame war, being a really good friend, etc.

(If you see a specific person(s) are being nominated quite a bit, try going for someone else! Everyone deserves a chance)

Post your nominations, and then you may put them in the Global Edit. If THT happens to see the Global Edit page, they will be able to review (easily) some pretty fantastic people!

[/details]

---

[details=What do we do now?]

I'm just going to wait, and see how this pans out.
Then I'll think about making a polling topic.
In the meantime, be a good roll model and be super awesome!

Thanks for taking the time to read this, by the way!

[/details]

- Yes, we need Community Leaders!

LazyLizard's Idea:
If there were to be leaders, maybe there could be different categories of leaders. Like one Leader to focus on the math topics, and a few leaders to harness the random stuff topic.

I think that'd be a really cool thing",5,1,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/the-disky-topic-ii-the-bad-sequel/36745/2358,2018-01-15 19:03:58 UTC

[details=A Quick Note]
Hey again 👋
I just wanted to add a quick thank you to all who read and participated in the 2 previous topics:

[Community Leaders on the Forum](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/community-leaders-on-the-forum/40074), [Polls about Community Leaders](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/polls-about-community-leaders/40101)

This topic is a recap on what happened in the previous topics. Now that we've got a whole bunch of people's perspectives and gathered some data, (and I finally learned how to make a public poll) I created this recap to show the view of the Forum on Community Leaders. And to talk about a few ideas.

Special thanks to @HopscotchRemixer because you're awesome 👏 

This is gonna be one elongated post, so props to you if you read it all 😂
I'm also going to be adding a special Global Edit post directly below this one so that you can add your awesome ideas 💡

>#### What are Community Leaders, and why were they here?
> ---
>
> A long while back in the early days of the Forum, (Feb 2016) we had been introduced to some Community Leaders! Here's the topic where Liza addressed about the new Community Leaders: [Leadership in the Forum](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/leadership-in-the-forum/7050)
>
>She goes on to say that she and THT were adding community leaders to the Forum, because it was getting really big, and it was hard to manage all of our awesome posts! I'd recommend reading the link, as it really explains why the leaders were on the forum, what they were supposed to do. If you want the short version, here's a summary:
>
>Leaders are just Regulars who have seen it all and set a positive example in all of their posts. The constantly demonstrate **kindness**, **helpfulness**, **maturity**, and **excitement** on building Hopscotch. People who have been chosen to be Leaders on the Forum help manage the Forum's safety for kids and well being, keep things happy and positive, present useful answers to questions, and make people excited to learn and share ideas.


>#### Where did all of the Community Leaders go?
>---
>
>As time went on, the Leadership position on the Forum had been rolled back and reserved for members of The Hopscotch Team (Sept. 2016). You can read about it in [this topic](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/changes-to-leadership-in-the-forum/23819).
>
>Liza describes how awesome the Community Leaders had been, but had decided to remove the Leadership position because THT couldn't support the Leaders. *For now.<secret message hrmmhrm>.*
>
>However, @t1_hopscotch, in May of 2017, became the first Hopscotch intern that was previously a user, just like you and me! Therefor, she became a leader. She's really great, and has helped out a lot on the Forum, keeping things positive and fun. But, she had become inactive in September of 2017.
>
>*Minor note*
>I recently just learned that @SmileyAlyssa and @Madi_Hopscotch_ (Previous Leaders) have become Hopscotch Curators! (As of Nov. 2017) They review the projects that have been nominated in the [Nominations for Featured](http://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/nominations-for-featured/6104) topic. Congrats guys! You can tag them at @hopscotch-curators 


  
>#### Should there be Community Leaders nowadays?
>---
>
>I've heard from many people that there should be Community Leaders in the Forum nowadays. In a poll of 65 Hopscotchers, nearly 50 of them agreed that there should probably be some Community Leaders. ([Proof](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/community-leaders-on-the-forum/40074))
>
>But why do they think that?
>There are many reasons why these Forumers want Community Leaders back. The main reason is to keep the forum safe for kids, positive, and neat. This is because there has been a *major* bullyin<hi>g issue recently:
>[Current Bully<hi>ing on the Forum](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/current-bullying-on-the-forum-situation-not-resolved/39623), [Forum Users being Impersonated](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/forum-users-being-impersonated-problem-not-fixed/39724/182)
>
>These Hopscotchers want some Community Leaders back on the Forum so that in situations like this, there will be an easy fix! But for now, we need to stay alert, keep our cool, and keep doing what we've always done.
>
>Why can't The Hopscotch Team do this?
>As said on previous topics by Liza herself, they can't contain the whole Forum! It's just too big with so much stuff going on. It's hard to keep track of it all. However, some Community Leaders would easily eradicate this and set the Forums at ease.
>
>Why can't we just ignore this bull<hi>y?
>It's a little tricky when users come up into topics that have been put a lot of work into, and start swearing, breaking the community guidelines, talking about illegal activity, and telling *your own friends* that they are not people and/or that they are stupi<hi>d. Just flag and keep your cool, and stand up for yourself and the Forum.


>#### Reasons for Community Leaders
>---
>
>● They keep the Forum positive, clean, and awesome!
>● They answer tough questions and give awesome insight
>● Theh create a safe environment for kids
>● They are roll models to look up to!
>
>These reasons alone are enough to get me on board to having some new Community Leaders


>#### Reasons against Community Leaders
>---
>
>● Causes rivalry among Hopscotchers to become a Leader
>● We can keep the Forum a positive place, even if we don't have Leaders
>● The idea of a ""special group"" of Hopscotchers that are better than the rest
>
>These reasons give some good conversations, and maybe want to rethink how the Leadership role should be

>#### Ideas for Community Leaders

>So now that we've seen the pros and cons to having Community Leaders on the Forums, what do you guys think about this? Add your ideas in the Global Edit post below 👌 Thanks

[details=A Quick Note]
Hey again 👋
I just wanted to add a quick thank you to all who read and participated in the 2 previous topics:

[Community Leaders on the Forum](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/community-leaders-on-the-forum/40074), [Polls about Community Leaders](https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/polls-about-community-leaders/40101)

This topic is a recap on what happened in the previous topics. Now that we've got a whole bunch of people's perspectives and gathered some data, (and I finally learned how to make a public poll) I created this recap to show the view of the Forum on Community Leaders. And to talk about a few ideas.

Special thanks to @HopscotchRemixer because you're awesome 👏 

This is gonna be one elongated post, so props to you if you read it all 😂
I'm also going to be adding a special Global Edit post directly below this one so that you can add your awesome ideas 💡

[details=1. Nuking a Topic]

How to nuke a topic:
While writing your post, copy and paste this as much as possible: <bi<hi>g> @system 
It doesn't need to be @system, you can write whatever you want.

[details=Effect]

Once you've posted a nuke, it is impossible to delete
The effect of nuking a topic is wild:

[quote=""MR.GAM3R, post:43, topic:40246, full:true""]
After a topic gets “nuked”, replying will be kinda glitchy. You won’t be able to directly respond to posts, and the reply box will disappear if you dismiss the keyboard.
[/quote]

Is there a fix?
Once enough replies have been posted below the nuke, the situation diverts and the page becomes normal again (unless you visit the nuked post)


[details=Screenshots]
![IMG_3127|333x250](upload://ldTzCgkqhI4nmHwacDIWhJKBlzv.PNG)![IMG_3126|333x250](upload://d1ufZqcewLic0PQBpdx32i4RuT0.PNG)![IMG_3125|333x250](upload://uAXhDg2aKvIEJ3RV0qeyGVgkCog.jpg)![IMG_3124|333x250](upload://wkZp8Jk57qkMxNABxhuqKZelb9Q.jpg)![IMG_3128|333x250](upload://i6uGkzuqwncxh8daFPHcEQJlgGU.jpg)
[/details]

[/details]

Update: Discourse will be fixing this really soon courtesy of me and William04Gamer: [Link](https://meta.discourse.org/t/topic-nuking-a-serious-glitch/78455)
<sub> (They deleted my topic for whatever reason)

[/details]

---

[details=2. Nuking a tag, the ""latest"" section]

How to nukes the ""latest"" section:
When writing tags for your topic, write one of them as: ﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽﷽

﷽ is the widest unicode character that fits into the forum. And since you are only allowed to have a tag be at max 20 characters, ""﷽"" is the widest for this form.

[details=Effect]

Once you've edited in this nuke, it is easy to delete (you must be regular to do it on someone else's topic), but it really messes up the ""latest"" section if you are on an Apple Device. (Chrome books are fine, apparently)

[details=Screenshots]
![IMG_3123|333x250](upload://nefcKv8cr44NYFhFS3o6m6K3JbZ.PNG)
[/details]

[/details]

As of now, Discourse does not know about this glitch.

[/details]

[details=3. Fredrick (fredrick) but as a username: @Fredrick]
This is an interesting bug that takes use of the blocked words: If a word starts with f and ends in k, the word becomes blocked: fredrick, firetruck, forgot-to-do-my-homework.

I have created an account called @fred<hi>rick and it is impossible to tag him: @Fredrick

[details=Effect]

It is impossible to tag @fred<hi>rick, even though he shows up as a username. Eternal peace!

Is there a fix?
No, unless the Hopscotch Team changes the guidelines of what to block, and directly unblocks fred<hi>rick as an inappropriate word.

How does this work?

As you may have noticed, these use overlapping characters. Interesting bug, right! To create these emoticons, they must be on their own line.

How to create:

</sub>

---

Type this:

<sub\>

:<hi\>/
:<hi\>^

To keep the emoticon on your post (because it sometimes turns invisible) remember to type some words above and below the <sub\>'s. Thanks!

• Workplace (not sure if you still wanted this one. I think it was a second level of mini games?)

Super Soup Simulator
——————————————————————


Goal:
Run your own soup shop! Get popular and create types of soup while exploring a city. Gotta get that 5 star rating

Places:

Hub Area
The hub area is the main city place where you walk around and interact with things. You can also enter certain buildings, trigger mini games, complete quests, and search for ingredients
The City works like a loop. If you walk in one direction for a certain amount of time, you will be looped back around.

Soup Shop

Market / Grocery Store-Buy ingredients for your soup

Workplace-Hire new workers to work at your restaurant

Billboard (Bill’s Board XD) ← news, hints, idk

Bus Stop-Fast Travel Point


Interactive Stuff:
Garbage Cans
• Jump in a garbage can to trigger a minigame (dumpster diving)
• Raccoon in a can (boss-ish mini game) (or this could mean that certain can is closed)
People
• Mailman: Idk, I think it might be funny
• Person walking a baby stroller
• Person walking a dog/cat/pet
• Jogger
• Random bystanders (common people)
•Chefs(you can hire me to work at your restraunt)
•Families of 3 and 4(groups of bystanders)
•Celebrities(when they buy food from your restraunt your popularity goes up temporarily)

Activities:
Quests
Finding/Creating Soups
Minigames

Ingredients:
Veggies
Meats
Spices
Noodles
Exotic Ingredients

Creating Soups:
Every soup is made of 3 ingredients. When particular ingredients are put together in the kitchen, an option appears telling you to, “Mix soup”
Once a soup is mixed and created, the recipe is added in the Cookbook.
___
Workers-You can hire workers from the work palace to work at your soup restraunt. You have to pay them once, and then they work forever. They automatically make soup, just tell them what to make.",10,1,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/super-soup-er-simulator/40430/2,2018-01-26 07:46:11 UTC

Should we bring back kid leaders and mods,Meta - Forum,-,No,"If you get flagged a certain amount of times, you lose regular

I figured out a way to ""nuke"" topics recently, and it made a topic essentially blocked
But then we told Discourse about it and they fixed it up

I also figured out how to make the layout on the ""newest"" extremely buggy, so we told discourse about that too and they fixed it

Other than that, the only thing that someone can do is spam tag the OMTL, but you can easily remove yourself from it.

The only thing close to something extremely bad is the xse situation, and the only thing we can do is flag him, ignore him, and contact THT. (Except he keeps on creating new accounts so idk)

Otherwise, if someone does something terrible that makes the forum wonky, we usually report it to discourse. But this has ever happened yet.

But I do think community leaders would be great
The only thing is that it creates competition because a ton of people want to be a leader, and only a few can be that responsible (Apparently, it's super tough work yikers)",12,3,https://forum.gethopscotch.com/t/should-we-bring-back-kid-leaders-and-mods/40489/3,2018-01-29 00:30:30 UTC

I would appreciate it if someone were to outright tell me to stop doing whatever I was doing instead of going straight to flags. I'll understand.

Let's go over what it means to flag something as spam:
Post is an advertisement, something that is overly promotional in nature instead of being useful or relevant to the topic as expected.

Idk, I'm just really confused as why my postos were considered an advertisement.

How to create alt accounts real quick:

When entering in your email addr<hi>ess in the ""sign up"" you can type in your actual email, except with an extra period in it, because g<hi>Mail overlooks periods, but discourse doesn't.

testmail@gmai<hi>i.c<hi>om = test.mail@g<hi>mail.<hi>com

They act as 2 different emails to discourse, but the Mail will be sent to the same account

Oh, yeah. They've only don't bug fixing for the past year. The inky thing that's new is being able to draw and animate objects. Which is *super cool* if you have the subscription

Things I'd like them to implement:

Strings in text. I want to add text together to make custom paragraphs and stuff. Variables in the text would make that easier to code.

Layers. Ugh, this neeeeds to be added. I simply despise the send to back and bring to front. Layers would act like a z-axis. If an object has a Layer = 1, it is behind another object that has Layer = 3. Think of the cool stuff you could make using variables!

About the flashily scratch, my dad adamantly didn't want me to download flash. I really did wish to help you and I even told you that you could make a topic and a poll of who had scratch and hs.

Ahhhhhh! This was a kind of silly setting.

I just doubled it to 100. 

I think Disourse, the company that built the forum software, designed likes to be a way of agreeing with a poster. So, instead of replying and saying ""yah!"", they just want you to like. So, they then wanted to prevent people from going on a spree and liking every post because that would make it less of a statement. Our forum is a little different though, and people like a lot.

Still use ""like"" as a way of agreeing, but agree with as many posts as you want.

Let's see how this goes!

>
>---
>There's been some talk about community leaders and whether or not they should make a return. We are pretty split so far on whether or not, most of us would say ""It depends"" but if given a choice of either yes or no, 75% of users agree that it might be a good idea to bring them back. 
>
>(If you want to catch up some more about this, read the references below)
>
>[details=Pros]
>
>**1<h>. Quickly Fix Situations**
>
>Community Leaders would be active enough to fix situations at the start
>
>Example 1: Xse situation. He would get banned nearly immediately and would not get the chance to spread his innapropriate behavoir across the forum
>
>Example 2: When the OMTL tag list got full when it hit 150 users, no one was able to tag it anymore. A Community Leader could've fixed that right away.
>
>**2<h>. Keep the Forum Running Smoothly**
>
>Community Leaders would be able to keep the forum running smoothly and easily keep things organized.
>
>Examples: They can create new categories, merge topics together, delete topics, lock topics, create groups, edit groups, undelete posts that were accidentally deleted, edit any post, remove any post, unlist topics, you name it. They can do a lot.
>
>--- 
>
>[/details]
>
>You get my point, Leaders can do a lot and can keep the forum efficient. Now let's look at some cons
>
>[details=Cons]
>
>**1<h>. Constant Competition**
>
> There might be some real nasty competition between users about whether or not who would make a great leader. Flame wars ahead :<h>/
>
>If you have more cons, please tell me, thx
>
>---
>[/details]
>
>Well, now that we've discussed the pros and cons about Community Leaders you may or may not have shifted your view on whether or not we should bring them back.
>
>[details=How we can Bring Back the Leaders?]
>
>If we do want to bring them back, how do we do it? The only way is to uniminously vote on it after lots of discussion, and then respectfully email Liza and THT. They have the real power when it comes to electing leaders.
>
>If we want to elect leaders, we should not choose on who we want to become a leader, we should have THT choose, if they even agree that they want Leaders back. This is because then whoever is the most popular should get the most votes, and when someone asks, ""Hey, would I make a good leader?"" no one is gonna disagree with you, because that'd be considered rude.
>
>This has brought about the term, ""False Positivity""
> It is where the truth may not be the best thing or most polite thing to say, so you just say something ""positive"" or basically just agree with what the person is asking because it'll make them feel good and stay friends with them.

>[details=Examples]

>Example 1: You have a really cool piece of art that you'd like to show the Forum. It's, like, the coolest thing ever bro! What should you do? Create a new topic because it's so splendiforous? Or post it on the Official Drawing Topic?
>
>
>Example 2: You've been on the Forum for a month, and it's time to celebrate! The forum is great! Should you, create a topic because you've been on for a full month, or have an epic bo snazzy party on your general topic?
>
>Example 3: You're fessed up about something that's happening and others are too. However, you see that they've already created a topic well describing the situation! Should you, create your own topic, because you can do it better, and you like the attention, oooor, agree with the other user's topic and add to the discussion?
